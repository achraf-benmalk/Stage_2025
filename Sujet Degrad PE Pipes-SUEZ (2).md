Descriptif du projet/stage

Context:
Microscopic  examinations  made  on  PE  pipes  aged  on  the  pilot  at  SUEZ  have  revealed  the
formation of an important deformation in the internal surface followed by its micro-cracking
when the pipes are subjected to a standardized punching combined with a chemical degradation
initiated  by  the  chlorinated  disinfectants  of  the  drinking  water.  SUEZ  asked  the  PIMM
laboratory  to  develop  a  model  coupling  the  effects  of  the  mechanical loading  and  chemical
degradation in order to predict this damage for two different generations of PE pipes (PE80 and
PE100).  The  PIMM  laboratory  decided  to  develop  this  model  based  on  a  methodology
composed  of  three  main  stages.  The  two  first  stages  will  consist  of  studying  the  decoupled
problem, i.e.:

1) The programming under Abaqus of a Finite Element (FE) model describing the mechanical
response  of  the  pipes  in  the  absence  of  chemical  degradation  and  before  any  damage.  The
reliability of this model was successfully checked from results available in the literature during
a first master’s internship last year.

2) The determination of the law describing the alteration kinetics of the mechanical properties
caused  by  the  chemical  degradation  by  performing  an  aging  campaign  on  pipe  samples  in
chlorinated water  at SUEZ,  followed by their characterization  with a multiscale approach at
PIMM. This multiscale approach will involve several complementary techniques:

-  Measurement  of the  Oxidation  Induction  Time  by  DSC  (OIT-DSC)  to  monitor the

chemical consumption kinetics of antioxidants,

-  FTIR  spectroscopy  in  transmission  mode  to  monitor  the  oxidation  kinetics  of  the

polymer,

- And tensile tests on dumbbell specimens to determine the consequences of oxidation
on  several  key  mechanical  properties:  Young’s  modulus,  yield  strength,  yield  and
ultimate elongations, etc.

The last stage of the methodology will consist in studying the coupled problem:

3) By introducing the law of alteration of the mechanical properties into the FE model and by
comparing  numerical  calculations  with  experimental  data.  In  particular,  it  will  be  tried  to
reproduce under Abaqus the damage observed when the pipes are subjected to a standardized
punching in chlorinated water at SUEZ. A particular attention will be paid to the deformation
of the internal surface of the pipes, the initiation of cracks and their propagation through the
wall  thickness  and  along  the  length  of  the  pipes  (i.e. the  shape  of  the  crack  network).  Pipe
samples  will  be  carefully  cut  around  and  far  from  the  damaged  areas  by  the  punch.  The
corresponding  polished  cross  sections  will  be examined  by  optical  microscopy  and  mapped
using  some  physico-chemical  techniques  (OIT-DSC,  FTIR  spectroscopy,  etc.)  in  order  to
determine the concentration profiles of antioxidants and oxidation products in the pipe wall,
respectively in the immediate vicinity and far from the cracks. The comparison of these profiles
will also allow evaluating the effect of mechanical deformation on the chemical consumption
kinetics of antioxidants and on the oxidation kinetics of the polymer.

Internships program:
-  Bibliographic  study  on  the  chemical  and  mechanical  degradation  of  polymer  pipes  by
chlorinated disinfectants,
- Post-treatment of ongoing experimental results,
- Realization of complementary (both physico-chemical and mechanical) experiments,
- Development of the FE code under Abaqus for pipe punching,
- Identification of the law of alteration of the mechanical properties,
- Introduction of this law into the FE model and solving of the multi-physical problem,
- Comparison of numerical calculations with experimental characterization,
- Proposal of practical solutions to reduce/avoid damage,
- Lifetime prediction of pipes subjected to the combined action of standardized punching and
chemical degradation.
