The  ductile-brittle  transition  of  an  ethylene-hexene  copolymer  was  measured  from  80  to  24 ~ C.
The  basic  curves  of  stress  against  time  to  failure  could  all  be  unified  in  terms  of  a  single
equation  based  on  normalizing  the  stress  relative  to  the  transition  stress  between  the  ductile
and  brittle  regions  and  using  a  single  thermal  activation  parameter.  This  unity  is  based  on  the
observations  w h i c h   s h o w   that  the  ductile  and  brittle  failure  processes  are  both  associated  w i t h

where  o- c is  the  minimum  stress  for  ductile  failure  at  an  arbitrary  temperature,  TR;  t R is  the  time
to  failure  at  an  arbitrary  reference  temperature  TR;  n  equals  34  and  3.3  for  the  ductile  and
brittle  regions,  respectively  and  R  is  in  J  mo1-1  K -1 .

1.  Introduction
In  the  neighbourhood  of  room
temperature  and
above,  polyethylene undergoes  a  ductile-brittle  tran-
sition where at high stresses it fails in a ductile manner
and at  low stresses the failure is brittle.  Brown,  Dono-
frio  and  Lu  1  analysed  this  transition  quantitatively
and  Brown and  Lu  2
investigated  the morphological
aspects  of  the  transition.  In  the  ductile  region  the
failure is  associated  with  macroscopic  yielding where
the  time  to  failure is  determined  by the  creep  rate.  In
the brittle region the failure is associated with the slow
growth  of a crack which emanates  from a defect in the
specimen.  Both failure mechanisms  occur together. At
high  stresses  the  creep  rate  dominates  and  at  low
stresses  the  rate  of crack  growth  dominates.  There  is
a  transition  region  where  the  time  to  failure increases
as  the  stress  decreases.  This  anomalous  transition
region  occurs  because  the  creep  strain  which  blunts
the  defect  reduces  the  stress  concentration  so  that
crack  growth  is  impeded.  Brown  and  Lu  2  have
nicely  correlated  the  blunting  with  the  changes  in
morphology  in  the  neighbourhood  of the  notch.

The  brittle  mode  of  failure  is  associated  with  the
following  events:  (1)  immediately  after  loading  the
specimen, a craze forms at the root of the notch whose
size  is  well  approximated  by  the  Dugdale  theory,  (2)
the craze grows slowly, (3) fracture initiates by ruptur-
ing the  fibrils near  the  base  of the  craze,  (4)  the  crack
then grows  at  an  accelerated rate and  (5) finally, when
the  remaining  ligament  reaches  critical  size,  ultimate
failure  occurs  by  yielding  of the  ligament.

The  ductile-brittle  transition  was  investigated  in  a

tough PE resin used for gas pipes.  A  unity between the
ductile  and  brittle  failure  modes  was  discovered.  By
normalizing the stress with respect to the critical stress
adjoining  the  brittle  and  ductile regions,  it  was  found
that the temperature dependence of the time to failure
was  the  same  for the ductile and  brittle regions.  These
results  are  useful  for  predicting  the  very  long  failure
times at  room  temperature in  terms  of the  experimen-
tal  results  at  elevated  temperatures.

2.  Experimental  details
The  polyethylene  is  an  ethylene-hexene  copolymer
with  4.5  butyl  branches  per  1000C.  M,  =  15000  and
Mw  =  170000. The density is 0.938 and the yield point
at room temperature is 21.5 MPa.  The specimens were
made from  10 mm  thick compression moulded plaque
which  was  slowly  cooled  overnight  in  the  press.  The
geometry  of the  single-edge  notched  tensile  specimen
is  shown  in  Fig.  1.  The  notch  depth  was  3.50  _+
0.01 ram.  The  1 mm  side  grooves  not  only  eliminated
most of the plane stress fracture but also decreased the
failure times.  Each notch was made with a razor blade
which  was  pressed  in  at  a  speed  of 50 #m rain- ~.

The craze and crack growth processes were observed
by measuring  the  crack  opening  displacements  at  the
surface  and  at  the  tip  of the  notch  and  at  the  base  of
the  craze  with  an  optical  microscope  (Fig.  2).

The  creep  curves  were  observed  on  an  unnotched
tensile  specimen  with  a  15mm
dumb-bell  shaped
gauge  length  and  a  4ram  x  4 mm  cross-section.  The
creep strain was measured with the microscope on two
scratches  1 mm  apart.

3.  R e s u l t s
Fig.  3 shows stress plotted  against time to  failure at 80,
70,  60,  50,  42,  and  24 ~ C.  The  stress  is  based  on  the
0 - - 3 4   and  in
unnotched  area.  In the  ductile  region  tr  ~
the  brittle  region  tr  ~  a  3.3. The  behaviour  in  the
transition  region  is  anomalous  where  tc increases  as  a
increases.  In the ductile  region  the notch  becomes very
blunt  and  the  failure  occurs  by  the  yielding  of  the
ligament.  In  the  brittle  region  the  failure  occurs  by
slow  crack  growth  which  initiates  at  a  craze  which
forms  at  the  root  of  the  notch.

Fig.  4  compares  the  ductile  failure  of  notched  and
unnotched  specimens.  In  both  cases  tr  ~  a -34.  The
failure time in  the  notched  specimen was  based  on  the
ultimate  fracture of the ligament  after general yielding
occurred in the ligament.  Failure time in the  unnotched
specimen was  related  to  the  initiation  of a  neck  that  is
associated  with  the  yield  point.  The  small  difference
between  the  ductile  failure  curves  of the  notched  and
unnotched  specimen  is  related  to  their  difference  in
geometry and  is not  associated with  a  difference in  the
failure  mechanism  which  is  caused  by  creep.  Creep
curves  of the  unnotched  specimens  are  shown  in  Fig.
5 at  80 ~ C  for various  stresses.  Necking  failure  occurs
when  the curves begin to  accelerate.  The critical  strain
to failure was about  70%  at  80 ~ C.  As the  temperature
decreases  the  creep  strain  at  yielding  decreases.  At
r o o m   temperature  the  strain  at yielding is about  12%.

Fig.  6  shows  the  typical  behaviour  in  the  brittle
region.  AA  is  the  notch  opening  at  the  surface  of the
specimen.  CC  is  the  notch  opening  at  the  root  of the
notch  and  BB  is  the  thickness  of the  fibrilla  structure
of the  craze.  The  fact that  BB  and  CC  are  very nearly
equal indicates that  the notch is sharp as a result of the
small amount  of creep that  occurs at the b o t t o m  of the
notch.  When  the specimen was initially loaded,  a craze
with  a  thickness  of about  50 #m  was  formed as shown
in  Fig.  7a.  The  craze  grew  in  thickness  to  about
150/~m  after  about  3  x  104 rain.  Figs  7b  to  d  show
the increase in size of the craze.  Fracture initiated  after
3  x  104 min  as  indicated  in  Fig.  6  at  point  c.  Fig.  7e
shows  the  craze  shortly  after  fracture  occurred  and
Fig.  7f shows  the  growing  crack  with  its  craze leading
the  way.  In  Fig.  6  the  slow  crack  growth  process
proceeds  from  point  d  to  g.  After  the  point  g  in  Fig.  6
the  remaining  ligament  rapidly  creeps  and  the  final
failure  process  occurs  by  the  ductile  fracture  of  the
remaining  ligament.  The  fact  that  the  AA  and  CC
curves  are  nearly  parallel  indicates  that  the  angle  of
the craze remains constant  during  most of the fracture
process.

Fig.  8  contains  micrographs  of  the  fracture  of  the
fibrils  in  the  craze.  Each  fibril  behaves  like  a  tensile
specimen  which  undergoes  necking  and  eventually
fractures  by  a  process  of shear  thinning  as  described
by  Bahttacharya  and  Brown  3.  On  a  microscopic
scale  the  failure  process  in  the  brittle  region  is similar

to macroscopic shear failure that  occurs in  the ductile
region. Whereas the average applied stress governs the
ductile  failure,  the  localized  stress  field at  the  root  of
the  notch  governs  failure  in  the  so-called  brittle
region.

An important aspect of the ductile-brittle transition
is  the  stress  that  adjoins  the  ductile  to  the  brittle
region. This critical stress which is the minimum stress
in the ductile region we call ac; it can be obtained from
Fig.  3.  The  curves  of crack  opening  displacement  for
these critical stresses are of special importance and are
shown  in  Fig.  9 for the  temperatures ranging  from 24
to  80 ~ C.  These  curves  are  essentially  linear  up  to  the
time when the initial fracture of the  fibrils occurs (i.e.,
crack initiation).  At  crack initiation,  the values  of the
COD based on an extrapolation of the linear region to
the  time  of crack  initiation  is  essentially  constant  at
1450/~m  between  24  and  70~
Plots  of  a0  and  ay
against  temperature are shown  in Fig.  10. ac is related
to  ~ry because  both  the  ductile  and  brittle  failure pro-
cesses involve shear  and  Cry is the basic  measure  of the
shear  strength  in  the  material.

The  temperature  dependence  of the  time  to  failure
for the  ductile region for a constant  stress  is  shown  in
Fig.  1 l.  The plots o f  log  tr against  I / T  vary with stress
with  slopes  of  270kJmo1-1  to  172kJmo1-1  as  the
stress  varies  from  5  to  7MPa.  The  temperature
dependence of the  time  to  failure in  the  brittle  region
is  116 kJ mol- ~ and  is  independent  of stress.

4.  D i s c u s s i o n
The  temperature  dependence  of the  time  to  failure  in
the ductile region depends on the temperature depend-
ence  of  the  creep  rate,  of  the  amount  of  strain  to
produce yielding and  of the yield point.  The creep rate
is a  thermally activated process governed by an activa-
tion energy. The yield strain changes with temperature
and  is  related  to  the  amount  of strain  that  the  amor-
p h o u s  and  crystalline  regions  can  sustain  before  the
lamella  structure  becomes  unstable.  The  effect of the
stress  is  relative  to  the  yield  point  of the  material  at
that  temperature  and  thus  the  temperature  depend-
ence of the  yield point  contributes  to  the  overall tem-
perature  dependence  of  the  time  to  failure.  It  was
found  that  the  temperature  dependence of the  time to
failure in the ductile region was unified by normalizing
the  stress  relative  to  ao rather  than  ay.  Fig.  12 shows
the  result  where  for  a  constant  value  of or/at

where Q  =  86 kJ tool -l . These results indicate that by
normalizing  the  stress  relative  to  ac  the  same  tem-
perature  parameter  held  for  time  to  failure  in  the
ductile and  brittle regions.  As  a  result all the curves in
Fig.  3  were  unified  by  plotting  the  normalized  stress
trexp  (85500/RT).  The  curves  were
cr/ao  against
reduced to a  single curve where the temperatures were
normalized to 24~  as shown in Fig.  14. In the ductile
region

tfD  =  9.3  x  10 ~ (a/at) -34rain

and  in  the  brittle  region

t~  =  2.2  x  106 (if/O-c)  -33  rain

At a/ac =  1; tfo/tfB  =  9.3/2.2  =  4.2which  represents
the  extent  of  the  anomalous  transition  region.  This
simple  unification  of  all  the  curves  in  Fig.  3  was  a
surprise.  It  demonstrates  a  unity  between  the  ductile
and  brittle  failure  processes  which  probably  is  based
on the fact that a  shear mechanism  is involved in both
regions.  Clements  and  Sherby 4
found  a  similar  uni-
fication  procedure  in  their  investigation  of  the  creep
behaviour  of  PE  under  compression.  Their  data
showed two  distinct stress regimes for the dependence
of the  creep rate  on  stress.  When  they  normalized  the
applied  stress  with  respect  to  the  stress  that  adjoined
the  two  regimes,  they were  able to  unify all  their data
in  a  manner  similar  to  our  discovery.

ductile  region  is  governed by  stress  and  temperature,
but  the  brittle  region  is  essentially  governed  by  the
stress intensity  and  temperature  as  shown  by  Lu  and
Brown  [5].  Thus,  the  ductile  region  is  essentially
independent of notch depth if the stress is based on the
notched area. The brittle region at a given temperature

should  consist  of  series  of  parallel  curves  which  are
shifted  in  accordance  with  the  notch  depth,  but  it  is
more fundamental  to plot stress intensity, K, against  tf
in the brittle region.  Lu and Brown [5] showed that for
this copolymer K varied approximately  a s   t f   1/4. As an
example  of  the  effect  of  notch  depth  on  tf,  Fig.  14

24 ~ C  is about  4 years for a  3.5 mm  notch.  The corres-
ponding  time  for  a  0.35 mm  notch  is  about  103 times
greater.

It  is  useful  to  predict  the  time  for  failure  at  low
temperatures  and  stress  from  data  obtained  in  the
laboratory  for  relatively  short  time  experiments  at
higher  temperatures  and  stresses.  Accordingly,  it
seems  necessary to  determine ac as  a  function  of tem-
perature  and  the  stress  exponents  in  the  ductile  and
brittle  region  and  the  thermal  activation  parameter,
Q.  The  stress  exponents  are  rather  independent  of
temperature  especially for  70~  and  below,  and  thus
can  be  determined  from  relatively  short  time  experi-
ments.  If o-~ is measured  as  a  function of temperature,
then  the  curve  can  be  extrapolated  to  a  lower  tem-
perature  of  interest.  Once  a~  is  obtained,  the  ductile
curve  can  be  drawn  according  to  its  stress  exponent.
The  brittle  curve  is  almost  determined  except  for  the
offset associated  with  the  transition  region.  The offset
is  about  a  factor  of 4  for  all  temperatures.

A  method  of  prediction  of  failure  in  the  brittle
region  that  is  now  being  proposed  by  an  ASTM
committee  is  based  on  the  equation

where  A,  n,  and  Q  are  assumed  to  be  independent  of
T  and  the  purpose  is  only  to  predict  failure  in  the
brittle region at low stresses.  At least three data points
are  required,  two  at  the  same  stress  and  different
temperatures  and  two  at  the  same  temperature  and
different  stresses,  but  all  data  points  must  be  in  the
brittle  region in  order to  determine A,  n  and  Q.  How-
ever,  the  above  equation  does  not  give the  maximum
stress  at which brittle behaviour occurs at a  particular
temperature.  Our  method  of prediction requires  more
data  points  but  is more  complete.  The most  revealing
information  about  the  slow  crack  growth  resistance
for different polyethylenes is shown by the curves of a c
against  T  and  o- c against  t r.  The  greater  tr at  ac and  at
the temperature of service, the better the polyethylene.

5.  Summary
It  was  found  that  the  curves  of  stress  versus  time  to
failure  in  the  ductile  and  brittle  regions  from  80  to
for  a  polyethylene copolymer  could  be  unified
