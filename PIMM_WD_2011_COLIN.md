ABSTRACT

Polyethylene (PE) pipes are commonly used for the transport of drinking water under
pressures  of  few  bars.  There  is  an  abundant  literature  on  the  results  of  isobaric  and
isothermal  ageing  tests  made  in  pure  water.  These  results  show  that,  at  ambient
temperature,  in  the  pressure  domain  of  practical  interest,  the  pipes  perish  by  brittle
fracture  with  lifetimes  exceeding  50  years.  There  were  considerable  research  efforts,  in
the past half century, to optimize the polymer structure and processing conditions in order
to  improve  the  pipe  durability.  In  the  last  decade,  however,  it  was  discovered  that
disinfectants, of which the effect was ignored in previous studies, attack the antioxidants
and,  presumably,  shorten  the  pipe  lifetime  because  PE  can  undergo  an  oxidative
degradation.  This  deleterious  effect  is  especially  pronounced  when  chlorine  dioxide  is
used as a disinfectant, but chlorine and bleach lead also to measurable effects.

The present chapter is aimed to answer the following question: Is it possible to build
a kinetic model leading to a prediction of the time to failure for a given PE pipe, at given
couple of temperature and pressure, for a  given disinfectant in a  given concentration in
water?

Such  an  investigation  must  cover  three  very  distinct  domains  which  will  constitute

the three main sections of this chapter:

1. Chemical  aspects:  Mechanisms  and  kinetics  of  disinfectant-antioxidant  and
disinfectant-polymer  reactions,  role  of  oxygen,  macromolecular  processes  (chain
scission) having consequences on the mechanical behaviour;

2. Transport phenomena: Penetration of disinfectants or their by-products in PE, loss by
extraction  and  evaporation  of  antioxidants,  couplings  between  these  processes,
composition and structure gradients resulting from diffusion controlled reactions;
3. Mechanical  aspects:  Kinetic  modelling  of  pipe  fracture  under  pressure.  Coupling

with chemical degradation.

Keywords:  Polyethylene  pipe,  water  disinfectant,  chemical  degradation,  kinetic  modelling,

lifetime prediction.

INTRODUCTION

Polyethylene (PE) pipes are widely used for the transport of gas or drinking water. It was
shown, more than 30 years ago, that pipes undergo a delayed failure, after a time tF depending
on the pressure p in the transported fluid, or better on the hoop stress  in the pipe wall, this
latter being linked to the pressure by:

(1)

where Dout is the outer diameter and L the wall thickness.

In former studies, it was assumed that PE does not interact with the transport fluids and
that failure results only from mechanical processes. Ageing tests were performed under static
pressure,  at  constant  temperature,  using  generally  pure  water.  The  practitioners  chosen  to
present experimental data in Log() = f(Log(tF)) plots. The shape of these latter is shown in
Figure 1.

The plots put in evidence the existence of two distinct kinetic regimes of failure: At high
stresses, approaching the tensile stress yield Y (Truss, 1986), fracture is ductile and the slope
Log()  /  Log(tF)  is  of  the  order  of  0.03.  At  low  stresses  (corresponding  to  the  pressure
domain of practical interest), fracture is brittle and the slope Log() / Log(tF) is of the order
of 0.3.

The  mechanism  of  slow  crack  propagation  raised  up  a  considerable  interest  in  the
community of polymer mechanics in the 80’s (Lustiger and Markham, 1983; Kausch, 1987;
Truss, 1987 and 1988; Huang and Brown 1988; Lu and Brown, 1990 and 1991).

(processing)  or  nanoscopic

At  the  end  of  the  80’s,  most  of  the  research  workers  were  convinced  that  slow  crack
propagation  is  exclusively  a  problem  of  polymer  mechanics.  Stress  concentrations  at
macroscopic
tie-chain
concentration, entanglement density in the amorphous phase and disentanglement rate under
stress,  were  generally  considered  as  the  most  important  phenomena.  At  the  same  time,
however, Gandek et al. (1989a and b) and latter Gedde and coll. (Karlsson et al., 1992; Smith
et al., 1992; Gedde et al., 1994; Viebke et al., 1996 and 1997; Neway et al., 2001 and 2004;
Lundback  et  al.,  2006a  and  b)  put  in  evidence antioxidant  loss  and thus, possible oxidation
induced failure of PE. Attention was then focused on antioxidant concentration profiles and
modelling of antioxidant loss kinetics. Two kinds of profiles were found (Figure 2).

Figure 2. Schematic types of stabilizer concentration wall profiles for pipes aged in pure water. The
stabilizer is lost by extraction by water at the water–polymer interface (z = 0) and by evaporation at the
polymer–air interface (z = L)

The loss of a stabilizer molecule initially located at the distance z of the surface can be
described  as  the  sequence  of  two  processes:  First  diffusion  towards  the  surface,  second
evaporation or water extraction at the surface.

by a (thickness dependent) first-order rate constant  (see below). As it will be seen later, one
can define a dimensionless parameter :

(2)

If  >> 1, diffusion is slower than evaporation or extraction, it governs loss kinetics and
one obtains profiles of type (a). If  << 1, diffusion is faster than evaporation/extraction, this
latter governs loss kinetics and one obtains almost flat profiles of type (b).

Indeed,  one  can  expect  an  intermediary  behaviour  when    is  of  the  order  of  unity  and
when  the  evaporation  rate  constant  ev  differs  from  the  extraction  one  ext.  In  the  case  of
phenols,  it  has  been  found  that,  generally,  ext  >  ev  (Lundback,  2006a  and  b;  Colin  et  al.,
2009b).

A the end of 80’s, some authors suggested a possible effect of disinfectant on PE ageing
(Tanaka  et  al.,  1987;  Henry  and  Garton,  1990),  but  detailed  literature  data  on  this  topic
appeared only one decade later (Bradley et al., 1997; Ifwarson and Aoyama, 1998; Gill et al.
1999; Hassinen et al., 2004; Dear and Mason, 2001 and 2006).

In  the  presence  of  disinfectants,  the  antioxidant  concentration  profiles  take  a  more
asymmetric shape (Figure 3). The profiles clearly show that a reactive species generated by
the disinfectant or the disinfectant itself penetrates in the polymer and attacks the stabilizer.
This  process  is  obviously  diffusion  controlled  since  the  depth  of  the  superficial  layer,  in
which  the  stabilizer  is  chemically  consumed,  is  generally  lower  than  the  half  thickness  and
rarely exceeds 1 mm.

In France, where chlorine dioxide is abundantly used, failures occurred especially in dog-
days  of  2003,  on  pipes  aged,  sometimes,  of  less  than  10  years  against  50  years  expected.
Indeed, a chemical attack accelerates pipe failure. Gedde and coll. (1994) have shown that it
is responsible for a third kinetic regime of rupture (Figure 4).

The  regime  (III),  in  which  failure  is  kinetically  governed  by  the  polymer  chemical
degradation, is represented by an almost vertical straightline. Depending on the degradation
rate, it can appear after the physical ductile–brittle transition (b) or before (c).

There is a strong request from water suppliers and users for failure prediction models in
which the input parameters would be the temperature T, water pressure p, disinfectant nature
and concentration [Dis] and pipe geometry. The output quantities would be the time to failure,
antioxidant concentration profile, and polymer degradation (ideally the polymer  molar mass
distribution)  profile.  Such  models  would  necessarily  be  composed  of  three  interconnected
moduli:  i)  A  “chemistry”  modulus  describing  the  antioxidant  and  polymer  attacks  by  the
disinfectant  or  its  by-products  and  by  oxygen.  ii)  A  “transport”  modulus  describing  the
transport of the reactive species, i.e. disinfectant, oxygen and stabilizer through the pipe wall
thickness. Here, transport equations must be coupled with chemical kinetic equations. iii) A
“mechanical” modulus describing failure kinetics and taking into account degradation effects.
As  it  will  be  seen,  various  “scenarii”,  based  on  different  starting  assumptions,  are
possible for each modulus. For instance, the following “scenario”, called “C1”, is often used
for the “chemistry” modulus: As long as it is present, the antioxidant protects the polymer but
this latter degrades rapidly just after the complete antioxidant disappearance. This scenario is
based on  the vast  experience on PE  thermal  oxidation  at  temperatures  typically  higher  than
70°C where it is well established that the end of the induction period coincides with the total
disappearance  of  the  antioxidant  and  that  embrittlement  occurs  at  the  end  of  the  induction
period. This “scenario” is reasonably realistic in the case of exposure in hot, non disinfected
water. At 25°C, however, the induction time for unstabilised PE thermal oxidation is about 20
years  (Khelidj  et  al.,  2006b),  that  suggests  a  long  delay  between  the  disappearance  of
antioxidants  and
the  polymer  embrittlement  (no  experimental  data  are  available).
Furthermore, water disinfectants can attack the polymer and induce an “extrinsic” initiation of

Log Log tF Log Log Log tF Log tF (a) (b) (c) (I) (II) (I) (I) (II) (III) (III) oxidation radical chains. This leads us to imagine a “scenario C2” in which there would be a
part of the polymer degradation induced by the disinfectant, and more or less independent of
the antioxidant presence.

One sees that antioxidant concentration profiles would be a key information in the frame
of “scenario C1”, but would appear less important in the frame of “scenario C2”. Ideally, a
model  would  include  all  the  chemical  events  belonging  to  both  scenarii,  and  the
predominance  of  “scenario  C1”  or  “scenario  C2”  would  not  be  decided  a  priori,  but
determined  by  the  model  in  function  of  exposure  conditions,  disinfectant  nature  and
concentration, etc …

A similar duality can be imagined for the “mechanical” modulus of the kinetic model. In
“scenario  M1”,  cracks  would  initiate  soon  and  the  pipe  lifetime  would  schematically
corresponds to  the time of  (slow)  crack  propagation  through  the pipe wall.  In  this case,  the
polymer  degradation  at  the  crack  tip  would  accelerate  the  crack  propagation.  Fracture
mechanics would be the most pertinent tool to predict the pipe failure kinetics. An example of
this type of treatment has been given by Piques and coll. (Hamouda, 2000).

In “scenario M2”, the pipe would undergo homogeneous creep under the water pressure,
and  failure would  occur  when a strain component  reaches  a critical  value depending  on  the
polymer chemical state. The crack propagation time would be considerably shorter  than the
crack  initiation  time.  Classical  (homogeneous)  polymer  mechanics  would  be  then  the  most
pertinent tool in lifetime modelling.

As it will be seen in the following sections, we have decided to elaborate a model based
on  a  “chemistry”  modulus  including  both  “scenarii  C1”  and  “C2”  and  a  “mechanical”
modulus  based  on  “scenario  M2”.  In  our  approach,  transport  phenomena  are  directly
incorporated into the chemical kinetic modulus, however it seemed to us interesting, for the
seek  of  clarity,  to  treat  them  in  a  separate  section.  The  text  will  be  thus  organized  in  three
sections  respectively  devoted  to:  1)  Chemical  aspects;  2)  Transport  aspects;  3)  Mechanical
aspects.

CHEMICAL ASPECTS

1. Preliminary Remarks

1.1. About the reactivity of disinfectants

Disinfectants are aimed to destroy the organic substances present in water, essentially by
oxidizing  processes  among  which  radical  ones  play  often  an  important  role.  In  the  case  of
saturated substrates, radical attack proceeds mainly by hydrogen abstraction:

R° + YH → RH + Y°

(kp)

Y°  → decomposition and other reactions

where YH is the substrate and R° a radical generated by the disinfectant.

The rate constant kp of hydrogen abstraction is a decreasing function of the dissociation
energy  ED  of  the  YH  bond.  For  instance,  in  the  case  where  R°  would  be  a  peroxy  radical
(PO2°), one would have, at ambient temperature (Korcek et al., 1972):

Table 1. Order of magnitude of Y–H bonds dissociation energy in organic substrates

335–355

(3)

kp being in l.mol-1.s-1 and ED in kJ.mol-1.

The order of magnitude of ED for various substrates is given in Table 1.
One sees that PE would be 4 to 1000 times less reactive than organic impurities, but its

reactivity would be non negligible over long periods (dozens of years).

In the same way, one sees that phenols must be attacked at a rate about 1000 times higher
than  PE.  The  shape  of  antioxidant  profiles  in  Figure  3  begins  thus  to  be  explained:
disinfectants  are  highly  aggressive  towards  phenolic  antioxidants  because  these  latter  are
highly reactive in radical processes.

1.2. About the nature of reactive species

The chemistry of disinfection in water media is relatively well known. Both radical and
ionic species (for instance ClO– in the case of chlorine or bleach) can have a strong oxidizing
power,  but  PE  acts  as  a  highly  selective  absorber,  because  ions  are  totally  insoluble  in  this
matrix. This characteristic was first discovered by Ravens (1960) in the frame of a study on
poly(ethylene  terephthalate)  hydrolysis.  PE  is  among  the  less  polar  polymers,  its  dipolar
moment is zero, its dielectric permittivity is 2.3. Only poly(tetrafluoroethylene) is less polar.
Ions are highly polar species totally insoluble in non polar polymers. Radicals, in contrast, are
more or less soluble depending on their solubility parameters.

Many “scenarii” are thus possible:







“Scenario T1”: The disinfectant is itself a radical which can migrate into PE. This is
the case of chlorine dioxide (DOC).
“Scenario T2”: The disinfectant generates radicals in the water phase and the radicals
migrate into PE.
“Scenario T3”: The disinfectant itself or a non dissociated molecule formed from the
disinfectant  in  water  phase migrates  into  PE  and  dissociates  into  radicals in  the PE
matrix.

One can have prescience that the identification of reactive species and the determination

of their concentration in PE is a challenging objective.

1.3. About the accelerating effect of disinfectant on mechanical failure

The  fact  that  mechanical  failure  is  accelerated  in  the  presence  of  disinfectants  is  well

established, at least in the case of chlorine dioxide (Colin et al., 2009b).

There  is  no  other  way,  to  explain  this  effect,  than  the  occurrence  of  a  chain  scission
process. As a matter of fact, at reasonably low conversion, only reactions leading to a change
in  chain  dimensions  can  affect  the  mechanical  behaviour.  These  reactions  belong  to  two
families: crosslinking or chain scission. Crosslinking would rather improve the resistance to
cracking,  therefore  only  chain  scission  can  explain  the  observed  effects.  In  PE,  at  ambient
temperature,  macro-radicals resulting  from  hydrogen  abstraction  can react  only  by  coupling
(i.e.  crosslinking)  or  disproportionation  (i.e.  without  chain  scission),  as  well  established  by
studies on radiolytic ageing (see, for instance, Schnabel, 1978). It seems that chain scissions
(at  ambient  temperature)  can  only  result  from  oxidation  processes,  more  precisely  from
rearrangement of alkoxy radicals (PO°):

Alkoxy radicals can result from hydroperoxide uni or bimolecular decomposition or from
non  terminating  bimolecular  combinations  of  peroxy  radicals.  The  global  simplest
mechanistic scheme could be the following:

where R° is a radical coming from the disinfectant, PH is polyethylene.

The rate of chain scission would thus be given by:

(4)

where S is the number of chain scissions per mass unit and  is the polymer specific weight
(≈ 940  20 kg.m-3). S is the yield of chain scission from alkoxy radicals.

S is obtained by integration of Equ. 4, when [POOH] and [PO° °OP]cage are obtained by

resolution of the set of differential equations derived from the above mechanistic scheme.

Saito’s equations (1958a and b):

(5)

(6)

MW must be preferred to Mn because it carries, generally, less incertitude. The polymer

toughness or the tensile ultimate elongation (R) varies with MW according to Figure 5.

On observes a relatively sharp ductile–brittle transition at:

 kg.mol-1

(7)

Below this limit, the polymer becomes extremely brittle. In fact, the molar mass change
is not directly responsible for embrittlement, the causal chain would be rather (Fayolle et al.,
2008):

Polymer oxidation → PO° radicals → chain scissions → chemicrystallisation → decrease

in interlamellar spacing la → embrittlement

The  critical  value  of  la  would  be  close  to  6  nm  (Kennedy  et  al.,  1994).  Using  extreme
crystallisation conditions, these latter authors have seen that it is possible to obtain critical la
values with polymers of molar mass significantly higher than 100 kg.mol-1. However, in the
practical  case  of  pipes  used  at  ambient  temperature,  the  critical  la  value  corresponds  to  a
critical MW value of (70  30) kg.mol-1.

1.4. About the role of antioxidants

Phenolic  antioxidants  (AH)  play  their  stabilizing  role.  It  is  widely  recognized  that  the

most important reaction is the hydrogen abstraction:

Stabilization (7) PO2° + AH → POOH + A°

(k7)

Phenoxy (A°) radicals can isomerise and their isomers can participate to various reactions
among which terminations with PO2° radicals, but this latter reaction is extremely fast so that
hydrogen abstraction is the rate controlling process, and one can write, in a first approach:

Stabilization (7) PO2° + AH → POOH + inact. prod.

(k7)

Radicals R° coming from the disinfectant can, indeed, react with phenols:

Deactivation (8d) R° + AH → inact. prod.

(k8d)

Both reactions have to be added to the previous mechanistic scheme with an additional

boundary condition:

[AH] = [AH]0 at t = 0.

One  can  expect  small  variations  of  the  phenol  reactivity  with  its  structure.  In  a  coarse
grain  study,  these  variations  can  be  neglected,  the  stabilizers  differ  essentially  one  from
another by their transport properties.

May antioxidants play a key role in polymer aging in the presence of disinfectants?
Disinfectants  play  (certainly  in  the  case  of  chlorine  dioxide,  probably  in  the  case  of
bleach) an “extrinsic” initiation role on polymer radical chain oxidation. It has been shown,
experimentally  through  gamma  irradiation  experiments  (Rivaton  et  al.,  2006)  and  from
kinetic  modelling  (Verdu  et  al.,  2003),  that  phenolic  antioxidants  loose  a  part  of  their
efficiency  when  “extrinsic”  initiation  occurs.  As  for  irradiation  (Khelidj  et  al.,  2006a),  one
can  expect  a  dependence  of  PE  lifetime  tF  with  initiation  rate  by  disinfectant  ri  having  the
shape of Figure 6.

Very  schematically,  two  kinetic  regimes  can  be  distinguished:  Regime  (I)  where
“extrinsic” initiation predominates over hydroperoxide decomposition, and regime (II) where
“extrinsic” initiation is negligible relatively to initiation by hydroperoxide decomposition.

The  stabilizer  is  expected  to  be  efficient  in  regime  (II),  i.e.  in  thermal  oxidation,  but
considerably less efficient in regime (I). This curve can be simulated with the above model
using an arbitrarily endlife criterion, for instance MF = 70 kg.mol-1.

Figure 6. Expected shape of the curve Log(lifetime) = f(Log(rate of “extrinsic” initiation)). Full line =
unstabilised polymer. Dashed line = stabilized polymer

The  problem,  here,  is  to  determine  which  regime  predominates  in  pipe  use  conditions.
The  classical  approach  would  consist  in  trying  to  accelerate  aging  by  increasing  the
disinfectant  concentration.  One  sees,  here,  that  the  concentration  dependence  of  lifetime
would be far from being linear, that discourages empirical modelling.

2. Chlorine Dioxide

The  peculiarity  of  the  chlorine  dioxide  (DOC)  molecule  is  that  it  is  a  free  radical  in

ground state:

It  is  moderately  stable in  aqueous  media. DOC  solutions must  be regularly  regenerated
(every  week)  during  long  term  ageing  tests.  As  a  free  radical,  it  can  abstract  hydrogens  to
organic substrates:

O=Cl–O° + YH→ O=Cl–OH + Y°

Its non ionic character allows its dissolution in PE.
Experiments on unstabilised PE thin films immersed in oxygenated, highly concentrated
(80–90 ppm) DOC solutions put in evidence the accelerating effect of chlorine dioxide on PE

Log tF Log ri (I) (II) ClOO
oxidation  (Colin  et  al.,  2009a).  The  molar  mass  and  ultimate  elongation  decrease  and
carbonyl  and  hydroxyl  groups  appear  after  exposure  of  1300  hours at  40°C.  Some chlorine
remains grafted to the polymer (Figure 7).

These results call for the following observations:

(a)  To  give  an  idea  of  the  accelerating  effect  of  DOC,  it  can  be  recalled  that  the
induction period of PE thermal oxidation in air at 40°C is of the order of 3.3 years
(Colin et al., 2007).

(b)  As previously observed, embrittlement occurs when MW approaches a critical value
of ≈ 70 kg.mol-1. There is no difference, from this point of view, between aging in
DOC solution and aging in air.

(c)  At the embrittlement point, the number of chain scissions is S = 5.2  10-3 mol.kg-1
and the number of carbonyl is [C=O] = 1.2  10-1 mol.kg-1. Only a relatively small
number of oxidation events lead to chain scission.

The simplest mechanistic scheme able to simulate the observed behaviour would be thus
the already established PE thermal oxidation scheme (Khelid et al., 2006b) to which two new
elementary  processes  would  be  added:  hydrogen  abstraction  to  PE  by  DOC,  to  explain  its
accelerating  effect  on  aging,  and  coupling  of  DOC  with  macro-radicals,  to  explain  chlorine
grafting (Colin et al., 2009a):

The boundary conditions for the resolution of the kinetic scheme would be:

 At t = 0: [P°] = [PO2°] = 0; [POOH] = [POOH]0; [PH] = 60 mol.l-1.
 A  every  t:  [O2]  =  [O2]E  =  3.8    10-4  mol.l-1  (it  is  considered,  here,  that  water  is
saturated  by  oxygen,  but  in  the  case  of  pipes,  other  boundary  conditions  can  be
chosen);

[DOC] = [DOC]E = 1.4  10-3 mol.l-1, where [DOC]E is the DOC concentration in PE, in
equilibrium with the aqueous solution. It is thus assumed that, for the thin films under study,
DOC consumption is not diffusion limited.

The  homogeneity  of  the  reaction  can  be  proved  from  steric  exclusion  chromatographic
data:  It  is  observed  that,  during  aging,  the  molar  mass  distribution  sharpens,  that  is  only
compatible with the assumption of homogeneous random chain scission.

The  10  rate  constants  characteristic  of  PE  thermal  oxidation  were  already  determined
(Colin et al., 2004; Khelidj et al., 2006b). The rate constant of reactions involving DOC can
be determined from experimental results using the kinetic model through an inverse approach.
But the DOC concentration in PE ([DOC]E) must be determined independently, which is not
easy owing to the low stability of DOC and the lack of experimental data.

A theoretical way for the determination of [DOC]E, essentially based on the closeness of
ClO2 and SO2 molecules, has been proposed by Colin et al. (2009a). Its description would be
out of the scope of this chapter, we will only recall the relationship between [DOC]E and the
DOC concentration in water [DOC]W:

(8)

where DOC = 1.7  10-5 mol.l-1.ppm-1 if [DOC]E is expressed in mol.l-1 and [DOC]W in ppm.

The activation energies for PE rate constants have been determined elsewhere (Colin et
al., 2004; Khelidj et al., 2006b). The activation energies for DOC reactions, determined from
data obtained only at two temperatures (Colin et al., 2009a), are very rough data, which could
be  modified  in  the  future  if  new  experimental  results  are  available.  In  the  above  form,  the
model is only valid for thin films or thin superficial layers of bulk specimens where DOC and
oxygen concentrations are assumed to be constantly in equilibrium with the aqueous medium.
Furthermore, eventual stabilizer reactions are not taken into account.

DOC–stabilizer reactions were studied only in industrial pipes exposed to accelerated or
natural aging. The results, mainly antioxidant concentration profiles in wall thickness, will be
presented in the section dedicated to “transport aspects”, but the data relative to reactivity can

in a process which can be simulate by a single reaction:

Deactivation (8d) DOC + AH → inact. prod.

(k8d)

where A is the phenoxy moiety and H is the functional phenolic hydrogen.

DOC has been found 1900 times more reactive with the phenol than with PE, a reactivity
ratio of the same order of magnitude as for PO2° radicals, which are 1200 times more reactive
with  phenols  than  with  PE.  Comparative  studies  showed  that  DOC  reactivity  is  not  very
dependent of water pH or polyethylene type.

3. Bleach and Chlorine

The basic reaction is the dissociation of (di)chlorine in water:

Cl2 + H2O

HClO + H+ + Cl–

(equilibrium constant: K = 4.2  10-4)

The chlorine solubility in water is relatively low (Durliat et al., 1997):

SCl2 ≈ 10-6 mol.l-1.Pa-1

ClOH is a weak acid:

ClOH

H+ + ClO–

(pK = 7.53)

The  equilibria  are  shifted  towards  the  left  when  acids  are  added,  and  towards  the  right
when bases are added. Thus, in highly acid solutions (pH < 3), chlorine is the major product.
In basic solutions (pH > 7.5), the hypochlorite ion ClO– is the major product. In solutions of
low acidity (3 < pH < 7.5), ClOH is the major product, its maximum yield is obtained at pH =
5. These three species have a strong oxidizing power, but only two are able to react with PE:
Cl2  and ClOH,  since  ions  are  insoluble  in  PE.  According  to  Holst  (1954),  when ClOH  and
ClO– coexist, they generate radicals in aqueous media:

ClOH + ClO– → ClO° + Cl– + HO°

HO° + ClO– → ClO° + HO–

ClO° + ClO– + HO– → 2Cl– + O2 + HO°

We  have  thus  the  possibility  to  envisage  “scenarii”  of  type  “T2”  where  radicals  HO°
and/or ClO° would be formed in water and then, would migrate into PE. Several authors have
envisaged this possibility, for instance Roesink (1989), Rouaix (2005) and Gaudichet-Maurin
(2005). In the case where hydroxyl radicals HO° would play the main role, one would expect
the  same  results  from  hydrogen  peroxide  as  from  disinfectants.  Fukutsa  and  Kokot  (2001)

have  obtained  results  effectively  similar  in  a  peculiar  case  where  ClO–  was  generated  by
electrolysis in the presence of bromine. Checking of this assumption in the case of PE–bleach
systems will be achieved in the next months in our laboratory.

As recalled by Durliat et al. (1997), ClOH and ClO– coexist only around a pH ≈ 7.5  1.0.
In  their  study  of  polysulfones  aging,  Rouaix  (2005)  and  Gaudichet-Maurin  (2005)  find
effectively a maximum degradation rate at pH = 8, that could be consistent with a “scenario”
of “T2” type. It would remain, then, to determine the relative part of ClO° and HO° radicals
in polymer degradation events. HO° radicals are small, i.e. they have high diffusivities in PE,
and  they  are  extremely  reactive,  probably  more  than  one  million  times  more  reactive  than
PO2° radicals (Denisov and Afanas’ev, 2005). ClO° radicals are larger than HO° ones, they
are characterized by a slower diffusivity in PE but also, presumably, by a reactivity several
orders of magnitude lower then HO° ones. The depth LR of penetration of a reactive species
in a polymer can be estimated from a simple scaling law (Audouin et al., 1994):

where D is the diffusion coefficient and K the first-order constant for the consumption of the
diffusing species by its reaction with the polymer.

It comes:

(9)

The  diffusion  coefficients  of  these  species  are  not  known  but,  from  comparisons  with
known values of current gases, for instance H2 and CO2 (Van Krevelen and Hoftyzer, 1976),
one can assume that:

(10)

So that, presumably:

(11)

(12)

HO°  radicals are presumably  scavenged  in  a  micrometric  or  submicrometric superficial
layer, whereas ClO° can penetrate deeply in PE pipe walls. According to this analysis, in the
frame of a “scenario T2”, at pH values of 7.5  1.0, the main reactive species would be ClO°.

One cannot exclude, however, cases where PE degradation would be maximum at pH <
7. In this case, the formation of Cl2 would be favoured and PE degradation would result from
a “scenario T3”, i.e.:

Formation of Cl2 in the aqueous phase → penetration of Cl2 into PE walls → homolytic

dissociation of Cl2 within the polymer matrix:

Cl2 → 2Cl°

Cl° + PH or AH → radicals and products

Thermal  dissociation  of  Cl2  is  very  slow  in  dark,  but  eventually  not  enough  to  be
negligible in large timescales. Dear and Mason (2001 and 2006) and Mittelman et al. (2008)
consider, more or less explicitly, that chlorine is the reactive species, i.e. that its dissociation
into Cl° radicals is not a rate controlling process despite the fact that it is considerably slower
than  the  reaction  of  Cl°  radicals  with  the  substrate.  Furthermore,  Mittelman  et  al.  (2008)
assume  that  the  rate  of  the  chlorine–phenol  reaction  is  the  same  as  the  rate  of  the  water–
phenol  reaction,  that  seems  to  us  a  highly  questionable  assumption.  To  our  opinion,  the
chemistry  of  chlorine  or  bleach  in  PE,  in  pipe  use  conditions,  is  far  from  being  totally
understood.

It will be necessary, in a next future, to establish unequivocally the nature of the reactive
species, in order to determine the corresponding transport parameters, that is not obvious in
the  case  of  unstable  species,  and  to  determine  elementary  rate  constants,  that  can  be  made
with model systems simpler to manipulate.

Comparative  data  clearly  show  that  chlorine  or  bleach  are  considerably  less  aggressive
towards PE than chlorine dioxide, but we do not know, for the moment, the exact reason of
this difference, which can be due to, at least, three causes:

(a)  A difference in reactivity of the radical species generated by the disinfectant;
(b)  A difference in solubility of the reactive species into PE matrix;
(c)  A difference in the generation rates of reactive species from the disinfectant.

TRANSPORT ASPECTS ANTIOXIDANT THICKNESS PROFILES

1. Induction Time Profiles

Some induction time thickness profiles are shown in Figure 8 for DOC and in Figure 9

for bleach. The origin of abscissa corresponds to the water–polymer interface.

These  results  call  for  the  following  comments:  Three  regions  of  the  pipe  wall  can  be
distinguished: The inner superficial layer (ISL), the core zone (CZ) and the outer superficial
layer (OSL). All the profiles are initially flat except for a small decrease in the OSL, revealing
some  antioxidant  loss  by  evaporation  during  processing.  The  initial  antioxidant  distribution
can be considered homogeneous in ISL and CZ.

The initial induction time in these regions does not vary strongly from a manufacturer to

another, it remains in the [140–175 min] interval at 190°C.

During exposure in the presence of disinfectants, the induction time decreases more fastly
in the ISL than in other pipe zones, showing that there is a reactive species coming from the
disinfectant (RSD) which destroys the stabilizer and that this attack is kinetically limited by
the RSD diffusion.

This  interpretation  is  clearly  confirmed  by  the  results  of  exposures  in  non  disinfected

water (Figure 10).

In the case of accelerated aging, very little changes are observed. In the case of natural
aging,  however,  there  is  a  general  decrease  of  ti  slightly  faster  in  the  ISL  than  in  the  other
zones.  It  is  clear  that  in  CZ  and  OSL,  there  is  a  physical  loss  of  antioxidant,  but  this
phenomenon is too slow to be observed in the timescale of accelerated aging tests. The faster

evaporation  as  already  observed  by  Lundback  et  al.  (2006a  and  b),  but  not  necessarily
generalizable to all stabilizer formulae.

Two important additional remarks can be made:

(a)  About the ISL depth: In the case of DOC (and perhaps, also, in the case of bleach, but
the results are not so clear), the separation between ISL and CZ is sharp, i.e. the front
of DOC attack is abrupt and its depth tends towards an asymptotic value of about 1
mm  independent  of  exposure  conditions,  i.e.  identical  for  accelerated  and  natural
aging.  This  result  would  be  unexplainable  if  DOC  was  consumed  only  by  reaction
with the stabilizer because, in this case, the boundary of ISL would be continuously
shifted towards the right until the complete disappearance of the stabilizer. The only
possible  explanation  (Colin  et  al.  2009b)  is  that  DOC  is  also  consumed  by  its
reaction with PE:

Initiation (Id) DOC + PH → ClO2H + P°

(k1d)

This is a second-order reaction, but at low conversions (i.e. [PH] ≈ [PH]0), it behaves as a

pseudo-first-order reaction:

(13)

where

 ≈ constant.

According to a simplified theory of diffusion controlled reactions, the depth LR of reagent
penetration in the case of first-order process is given by Equ. 9. Since, here, accelerated aging
tests have been made at temperatures close to the ambient temperature, D and K values are
not very different from natural ageing ones, and the depth of ISL must be almost the same, as
experimentally observed.

(b)  About the flatness of profiles: As mentioned in the introduction, antioxidant profiles
remain  flat during aging (in the regions not reached by  the RSD, indeed) when the
rate  controlling  physical  process  is  evaporation  or  extraction  by  water  or  both.  In
such cases, the pertinent boundary condition at the sample surface is:

(14)

 has the dimension of a first-order rate constant with the following physical meaning for
evaporation  (the  same  reasoning  can  be  made  for  extraction  by  water):  If  pure  antioxidant
evaporates  at  a  rate  r0  (in  mol.m-2.s-1),  it  is  assumed  that,  in  a  polymer  containing  an
antioxidant in concentration [A], the evaporation rate would be:

where [A]S is the antioxidant concentration at saturation and hV (m.s-1) is a characteristic of
antioxidant.

Bottom: Natural ageing in various sites in France. Pipe ages are: 0 hours (0); 7 years (1); 13 years (2);

15.5 years (3).

For a sample of thickness L, the change in concentration is thus given by:

where

is a first-order rate constant (s-1).

The time constant for this process would be:

The time constant for antioxidant diffusion is:

(16)

(17)

(18)

One  can  thus  define  a  dimensionless  ratio  (Crank,  1975;  Calvert  and  Billingham,  1979

and 1980):

(19)

Then, if  >> 1, evaporation is faster than diffusion. The stabilizer concentration is close
to zero in the superficial layers and increases regularly towards the CZ. On the contrary, if 
<< 1, evaporation is slower than diffusion and controls antioxidant loss kinetics. Diffusion is
fast enough to homogenize the antioxidant distribution at every time, the profile is flat.

Here,  apparently,  we  are  always  in  the  case  where    <<  1  at  ambient  temperature,  for
wall thicknesses such as: 3 mm  L  5 mm. But, we do not exclude to observe the diffusion
controlled  regime  for  higher  wall  thicknesses  and/or  higher  temperatures  or  for  other
stabilizers.

2. Degradation Profiles

A carbonyl concentration thickness profile superimposed to the corresponding induction
time thickness profile, in  the case of  accelerated  aging in  a highly  concentrated DOC  (66.5
ppm) solution at 40°C, is shown in Figure 11.

The  carbonyl  concentration  decreases  pseudo-exponentially  with  depth  and  vanishes  at
about  600  µm  depth,  whereas  the  antioxidant  is  destroyed  until  about  1  mm  depth.  These
results call for two important remarks which can be generalized to other aging conditions:

(a)  Oxidation is diffusion limited and obviously initiated by RSD, otherwise the profile

would be symmetrical.

(b)  The  oxidation  area  is  sharper  than  the  antioxidant  attack  area,  both  phenomena  are
not  simply  interrelated.  Since  we  suppose  that  oxidation  is  the  cause  of
embrittlement,  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  relationship  between  the  antioxidant
profile and the pipe lifetime, if such a relationship exists, must be very complex.

3. Incorporation of Diffusion Terms into the Kinetic Model

The case of chlorine dioxide (DOC) (Colin et al. 2009a) will be taken as an example, but
the  principle  remains  the  same  for  other  mechanisms.  Here,  three  molecular  (e.g.  mobile)
reactive species have to be taken into account: chlorine dioxide (DOC), antioxidant (AH) and
oxygen (O2). Their concentration changes are governed by differential equations derived from
the mechanistic model. A diffusion term will be added to each of these equations (Colin et al.,
2009c). These equations are:

For oxygen:

For stabilizer:

(21)

where DO2, DAH and DDOC are respectively  the diffusion coefficients of oxygen, antioxidant
and chlorine dioxide in PE.

With  the four  other  differential  equations describing  the  concentration  changes  of  [PO°
°OP]cage,  P°,  PO2°  and  POOH,  these  equations  constitute  the  nucleus  of  the  kinetic  model.
This  system  of  7  equations  can  be  resolved  in  time  t  and  space  z,  using  a  finite  difference
(Colin et al., 2009c) or a finite element method (Olivier et al., 2009) with pertinent boundary
conditions. The resolution gives the concentration value of every reactive species at any time
and  any  depth  in  the  wall  thickness.  Using  Equs  4–6,  it  is  then  possible  to  determine  the
weight average molar  mass MW at every time, every depth, which is the key information to
build the “mechanical” modulus of the model.

MECHANICAL ASPECTS

1. Strategy of Model Elaboration

As mentioned in  introduction,  we chosen  the  “scenario M2”  to  predict  the  pipe failure,
although  at  this  state  of  our  knowledge,  “scenario  M1”  cannot  be  definitively  rejected.
“Scenario M2” can be schematized by Figure 12.

Figure 12. Schematization of “scenario M2” for pipe failure (see text)

Under  a  hoop  stress  ,  the  pipe  undergoes  creep.  Under  this  creep,  the  polymer  can
eventually  reach  a  critical  deformation  state  where  cracks  initiate  and  then,  propagate
catastrophically owing to accelerating effects of stress concentrations. The mechanisms of PE
failure under static stress are now relatively well understood (see for instance Galeski, 2005;
Plummer, 2005), but not at the point where they could be translated into equations able to be
used in a kinetic model. Here, it will be assumed that there is an unspecified strain component
 (whole macroscopic strain? Anelastic macroscopic strain? Strain localized in the amorphous
interlamellar  region?  etc  …)  and  that  failure  occurs  when  this  strain  component  reaches  a
critical value:  = F. In a first approach, it is assumed that the creep kinetic law:  = f(, T, t)
is  independent  of  polymer  degradation.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  in  the  conversion  range  of
interest, degradation modifies only the large scale structure of macromolecules, but does not
modify significantly the molecular motions responsible for viscoelasticity, except in the final
phase  where  chain  reptation  (De  Gennes,  1971)  becomes  important.  In  contrast,  the  failure
criterion  F  depends  on  polymer  structure,  especially  of  molar  mass  MW,  through  a
dependence  having  presumably  the  shape  of  Figure  5.  Two  cases  have  then  to  be
distinguished:





In  the  absence  of  disinfectant,  there  is  no  change  of  molecular  weight,  the  failure
criterion remains constant: F = F(0), and fracture occurs at time tF = tF(0).
In  the  presence  of  disinfectant,  there  is  a  molecular  weight  decrease  and  then,  a
decrease  of  the  failure  criterion:  F  =  F  (D).  Fracture  occurs  thus  at  time  tF(D)  <
tF(0).

Schematically:  The  chemical  model  predicts the  change  in  molar  mass:  MW  =  g(t).  We

need in addition:

 A kinetic law for creep:  = f(t);
 A relationship linking the fracture criterion F to MW.

The lifetime would be then given by:

where f-1 is the reciprocal function of f.

In practice, temperature and eventually stress undergo fluctuations, for instance seasonal
variations  of  temperature.  These  fluctuations  can  be  eventually  taken  into  account  in  the

model if we start from rate expressions:

(24)

The effect of stress and time is determined by viscoelastic deformation mechanisms and
can  take  complex  mathematical  forms  (Ferry,  1980).  Here,  it  has  been  chosen  to  take  an
extremely simple form, but with a constraint: Applying a constant failure criterion, one must
obtain  results  consistent  with  literature  data  according  which,  in  the  absence  of  polymer
degradation:

where A is temperature dependent and b ≈ 0.3.

The simplest kinetic creep law fulfilling the above conditions would be:

where k and a are constants.
The integration gives:

Failure occurs at t = tF such as:

This equation is equivalent to Equ. 25:

where

(30)

At this state of our knowledge, k, i.e. also A, is an adjustable parameter. Equ. 26 could
thus predict the observed behaviour (in the absence of disinfectants) provided that b = (1 – a)
≈ 0.3 i.e. a ≈ 0.7.

According to the chosen assumption, b is a characteristic of the creep mechanism, which
remains  unchanged  during  polymer  degradation.  In  other  words,  the  stress–lifetime  graph
(Figure 1) for a polymer before (i) and after (f) degradation would have the shape of Figure
13.

Schematically,  there  is  no  significant  change  in  behaviour  in  ductile  regime,  but
degradation, i.e. molar mass decrease, induces a translation of the straightline characterizing
brittle regime towards short time.

3. Failure Criterion

If,  as  assumed,  a  decrease  in  molar  mass  induces  a  translation  of  the  “brittle  regime”
straightline  in  Figure  13,  this  means  that  the  prefactor  A  in  Equ.  25  or  k  in  Equ.  28  must
depend on molar mass. This dependence can be understood on the following physical basis:

TFea1kALog(tF) Log() tCf tCi (i) (f) In  the amorphous phase of PE,  the  macromolecules  are  entangled and  behave as a physical
network able to resist to cavitation under service stresses. However, at ambient temperature,
i.e.  relatively  far  above  its  glass  transition  temperature  (≈  -  40°C),  the  amorphous  phase  is
“stirred” by  molecular  motions of various types among which reptation (De Gennes, 1971).
PE  chains  can  disentangle  by  reptation,  but  the  characteristic  time  of  disentanglement  tdis
increases rapidly with the chain length, typically:

(31)

Indeed,  if  a  polymer  is  continuously  loaded  for  a  time  longer  than  the  disentanglement
characteristic  time,  it  behaves  as  a  non  entangled  polymer  with  practically  no  resistance  to
cavitation and failure. The transition time tC between ductile (I) and brittle (II) regimes is thus
expected to be a sharply increasing function of molar mass, i.e. a rapidly decreasing function
of the number of chain scissions.

Colin et al. (2009b) decided to represent the influence of molar mass by a power law, that

leads to the following equation:

(32)

For the PE under investigation, at 15°C, the parameter values were:

A0 = - 29.7; B / T = 30.2; C = 3.2; and 1 / (1 – a) = 3.3.

We can now understand why the slope Log() / Log(tF) in Figure 4 is almost vertical

in regime (III), as illustrated in Figure 14.

Let  us  consider  a  PE  sample  having  an  initial  molar  mass  MW0.  In  the  absence  of
disinfectant, at the stress , it would undergo failure at point A at time tF0. After a certain time
of ageing, its molar mass would decrease and take the value MW. The straightline of regime
(II) would be translated towards the left and failure would occur in the point B for the stress
, the time to failure being tF1. Let us now consider the behaviour at a stress ( – ). For a
molar  mass  MW,  fracture  would  occur  at  the  point  C,  corresponding  to  the  lifetime  t’F1.
However, during the excess of lifetime relatively to tF1, degradation continues and the molar
mass  becomes  (MW  –  MW),  that  corresponds  to  a  new  translation  of  the  straightline  of
regime (II) towards the left and thus, to a rupture at the point D corresponding to a lifetime tF2
such  as:  tF1  <  tF2  <  t’F1.  One sees  that  locally,  the slope  of  the curve Log()  =  f(Log(tF))  is
expected to be higher than the slope of the straightline of regime (II). The slope ratio depends,
indeed, on the polymer degradation rate. If this ratio is high enough, the curve in regime (III)
will appear almost vertical and practically undistinguishable from a straightline, although it is
not probably a straightline.

4. Integration of the “Mechanical Modulus” into the Lifetime Prediction
Model

According to the chosen assumptions, creep is expected to be homogeneous in the whole
pipe wall thickness. However, embrittlement due to polymer degradation is localized, as seen
in previous sections, in a relatively thin superficial layer. Cracks initiate and propagate easily
in the degraded layer when the molar mass is lower than ≈ 70 kg.mol-1. The problem is now
to determine if cracks will  stop at the degraded/non degraded interface or if they will cross
this latter and lead to the pipe failure.

From a simple application of Equ. 1, one sees that, since cracks reduce the wall thickness,

they increase the stress. By derivation, one would obtain:

(33)

According  to  the  bases  of  fracture  mechanics  (Griffith,  1920),  there  is  a  critical  defect
size (i.e. here a critical depth of degraded layer) beyond which cracks propagate in the sample
core  and  induce  fracture.  This  concept  has  been  refined  later  (Rolland  et  al.,  1982;
Schoolenberg, 1988). In the case of PE radiochemical oxidation, Audouin and Verdu (1991)
have put in evidence (from tensile tests) the existence of a critical thickness of the oxidized
layer, of the order of 200 µm, beyond which thick samples become brittle.

Rigorously  speaking,  it  would  be  necessary,  in  the  case  under  study,  to  establish  the
kinetics  of  crack  propagation  in  a  material  characterized  by  a  toughness  gradient  in  the
superficial  layer.  In  a  first  approach,  we  will  propose  a  simpler  approach  which  can  be
summarized as follows: A critical depth LC would be of the order of 100 µm. It is considered
that,  when  the  molar  mass  reaches  a  value  of  ≈  70  kg.mol-1  at  this  depth,  cracks  propagate
into the wall core and pipe failure occurs.

Lifetime  was  calculated  on  this  basis,  in  the  case  of  DOC  disinfectant.  The  results  are

shown in Figure 15.

CONCLUSIONS

In the normal use conditions for water transport in polyethylene pipes, brittle failure must
occur after a finite time, but in the case of pure water, this latter must exceed 50 years, that is
economically  acceptable.  Disinfectants  such  as  chlorine,  bleach  or  chlorine  dioxide  can
induce  polymer  degradation  through  oxidative  processes,  and  reduce  lifetime  at  eventually
unacceptable values. This problem has raised up a relatively abundant scientific and technical
literature since the beginning of 80’s.

It  is  now  clear  that  any  kinetic  model  aimed  to  predict  the  pipe  lifetime  must  involve

elements coming from three distinct disciplines:

(i)  Radical chemistry in polymer matrix and its kinetic modelling to explain the role of

disinfectant nature and concentration on polymer degradation;

0.11101001E+011E+021E+031E+041E+051E+061E+07time (h) (MPa)15°C9°CT = 24°C(I)(II)(III)(ii)  Transport  phenomena  (coupled  with  chemistry)  to  explain  the  depth  distribution  of

reactive species into the wall thickness;

(iii) Mechanical failure processes and their coupling with polymer degradation.

Concerning first chemical aspects, it seems that PE can perish only by chain scission and
that  this latter  can result  only  from  oxidation.  Most  of  the authors  involved in  this research
have considered more or less implicitly that antioxidants play a key role in this process, that
leads to give a key importance to antioxidant thickness profiles. In the model proposed here,
the  role  of  antioxidants  would  have  an  importance  varying  in  the  opposite  way  as  the
agressivity  of  disinfectants.  Antioxidants  would  play  a  determining  role  in  pure  water,
practically no role in the case of DOC disinfected water, and probably an intermediary role in
bleach  or  chlorine  disinfected  water.  To  our  opinion,  chemical  mechanisms  are  reasonably
well  elucidated  in  the  case  of  DOC,  but  open  questions  remain  in  the  case  of  chlorine  or
bleach.

Concerning  transport  aspects,  the  main  obstacle  is,  no  doubt,  to  determine  the  basic
parameters, i.e. solubility and diffusivity coefficients of species characterized by a relatively
low solubility, a relative instability, and a reactivity with the matrix and its antioxidants. The
knowledge of these quantities is absolutely needed for the model elaboration.

Concerning mechanical aspects, it is obvious that the assumptions made here are strong
oversimplifications, but it seems to us that the strategy of modelling is pertinent and open to
more sophisticated approaches, as well for creep kinetics as for failure mechanisms, and the
influence of degradation on these latter.  It seems important to keep in mind that  the model,
whatever  the  chosen  scheme,  must  predict  the  stress–lifetime  relationship  observed  in  the
absence of disinfectants for which a considerable set of experimental data is available.
