Polyethylene connection pipes of wall thickness rang-
ing from 3.0 to 4.5 mm, used for 0, 5, 9, 12, and 18
years in the French network of drinking water disin-
fected by bleach, have been analyzed. The stabilizer
thickness proﬁles reveal that bleach destroys the sta-
bilizer in a superﬁcial layer of about 0.5 mm depth at
the water–polymer interface.
In the rest of the wall,
stabilizer is lost by physical processes, i.e., transport
by diffusion into the bulk, extraction at the water–poly-
mer interface, and evaporation at the polymer–air inter-
face. The whole loss kinetics is governed by extraction
and evaporation. The classical scheme for evapora-
tion–diffusion process has been used to model physi-
cal loss processes, but with boundary conditions dif-
ferent from the literature ones. Concerning chemical
aspects, some mechanisms proposed in the literature
are criticized. The identiﬁcation of the bleach reactive
species remains an open question. POLYM. ENG. SCI.,

INTRODUCTION

A polyethylene (PE) pipe transporting water at temper-
ature T and pressure p (inducing a hoop stress r) is
expected to undergo failure after a ﬁnite time tF. Here,
only stresses signiﬁcantly lower than a critical value of
the order of 10 MPa, covering the whole pressure range
used in practice, will be considered. In this stress range,
pipes always perish by brittle fracture. At temperatures
typically lower
radical
reagents, fracture results from purely physical processes.
The stress dependence of lifetime can be approximated by
a power law:

Among structural factors involved in A(T), molar mass
distribution is especially important because it governs
many properties playing a key role in fracture,
for
instance: chain disentanglement rate in the amorphous
phase [4, 5] and in craze ﬁbrils [2, 6], tie-chains concen-
tration [7, 8], and interlamellar spacing [9, 10], the last
one being found to determine the regime of fracture in
tension [10].

It seems thus that, if, in addition to mechanical load-
ing, the polymer undergoes a chain scission process, A(T)
is expected to decrease, the curve log r ¼ f(log tF) is
expected to become an almost vertical straight line [11],
as experimentally observed [11, 12], and, thus, the life-
time is expected to shorten.

There is, to our knowledge, only one possible cause
of chain scission for PE in the relatively soft use condi-
tions of water pipes: radical chain oxidation. The main
chain scission precursors, in the context of low temper-
ature oxidation, are secondary alkoxy radicals, which
can abstract hydrogens to give alcohols, but also rear-
range to give a chain (b) scission. Alkoxy radicals can
result from hydroperoxide decomposition or can escape
from the cage in nonterminating bimolecular combina-
tions of peroxy radicals [13]. Oxidation can be initiated
can
by hydroperoxide decomposition. This process

predominate at high temperature, but it would be very
slow at temperatures lower than 508C. A recent kinetic
study of the low-temperature oxidation of unstabilized
PE [14] lead to estimate a value of about 20 years for
the induction time at ambient temperature (the time to
embrittlement would be of the same order). Indeed, it
would be considerably longer in the presence of stabil-
izers, as conﬁrmed by extrapolations of induction times
determined at high temperature [15]. At low tempera-
ture, however, initiation of radical chain oxidation can
also be due to the polymer attack by water disinfec-
tants. These latter, which are aimed to destroy organic
substances by radical processes, cannot be totally selec-
tive. Furthermore, even in the case where their reactiv-
ity toward PE was negligible, they would attack pheno-
lic antioxidants of which the functional hydrogen is a
thousand times more reactive than methylenic hydro-
gens of PE, and, thus, they would have a negative indi-
rect effect on pipe durability.

In addition to chemical consumption by reaction with
reactive species coming from PE oxidation (peroxy radi-
cals) or from the disinfectants, stabilizers can be lost by
physical processes, essentially extraction by water at the
water–polymer interface and evaporation at the polymer–
air interface. This is the reason why it is now well recog-
nized that the analysis of antioxidant thickness proﬁles is
of key importance to understand pipe ageing processes
[16–20]. The simplest experimental approach,
in such
investigations, consists to machine thin slabs at various
depths in the pipe wall thickness and to determine their
oxidation induction time (OIT) at high temperature, for
instance at 1908C or 2008C using isothermal differential
scanning calorimetry. It can be assumed, at least, in a ﬁrst
approach that the induction time for phenolic stabilizers is
proportional to the residual stabilizer concentration [21,
22]. Stabilizer proﬁles in pipe walls have been already
reported, but essentially in the context of accelerated age-
ing [16–20]. In the case of natural ageing, isolated data
are available [19], but systematic studies are scarce for
obvious economic reasons and also because signiﬁcant
data can be obtained only when the pipe history is
known.

In France, premature failures due to chlorine dioxide
(DOC), at the beginning of the 2000s, created favorable
conditions for such systematic investigations. A ﬁrst set
of articles was dedicated to a study of DOC effects [19,
23, 24]. This article is devoted to the study of samples
taken in the part of the French network of drinkable water
disinfected by bleach.

EXPERIMENTAL

Connection pipes of PE80 or PE63 generation, of 30–
45 mm diameter and respectively 3.0–4.5 mm wall thick-
ness, having various manufacturer origins, were taken in
several parts of the French network of drinking water dis-
infected by bleach or DOC, or free of disinfectant. Their

characteristics obey the French standard: NF EN 12201.
They present the following characteristics: 2.0–2.5% by
weight of carbon black; melting point, Tm (cid:3) 120–1308C;
crystallinity ratio, Xc ¼ 35–45%; weight average molar
mass, Mw ¼ 100–150 kg mol21; and OIT at 1908C, ti ¼
165 6 15 min.

Pipes were machined and slabs of 0.5 mm thickness
were taken at various depths in the pipe wall. Slabs were
cut into samples of 5–10 mg and analyzed by differential
scanning calorimetry to determine the local OIT ti at
1908C in a pure oxygen ﬂow of 50 ml min21. The local
residual stabilizer concentration was determined according
to the classical relationship:

where ti0 and ti, and [AH]0 and [AH] are, respectively,
OITs and stabilizer concentrations before and after aging.

RESULTS

Examples of induction time proﬁles for pipes taken in
the French network of drinking water disinfected by
bleach are shown in Fig. 1. In each proﬁle, the ﬁrst point
on the left side corresponds to the superﬁcial layer in con-
tact with water, and the last point on the right side corre-
sponds to the outer superﬁcial layer (OSL). These proﬁles
reveal the existence of three distinct zones: the inner su-
perﬁcial layer (ISL), the core zone (CZ), and the OSL.
They call for the following comments:

Pipes were of various sources. Virgin samples elabo-
rated in 2005 [24] were arbitrarily chosen to establish the
initial proﬁle seen in Fig. 1. This proﬁle is ﬂat in most of
the wall
in OSL where a relative
decrease of about 25% is observed. This feature is sys-
tematically observed in virgin pipes [25, 26]. It reveals
some stabilizer loss by oxidation and/or evaporation dur-

DISCUSSION

Globally,

the explanations proposed in our previous
articles about DOC effects [19, 23, 24] remain valid
here: The reactive agent coming from bleach acts only
in ISL, as shown by comparison of Figs. 1 (bleach)
and 2 (no disinfectant). The comparison between Figs. 1
and 3 (DOC) shows that bleach is considerably less
aggressive than DOC. This latter destroys totally the
antioxidant

measurable after 12 years in the case of bleach-disin-
fected water.

layer,

In the case of DOC, the depth of ISL tends toward an
asymptotic value of the order of 1 mm, almost independ-
ent of DOC concentration in water. This feature can be
explained by the fact that DOC is also consumed by its
reaction with PE:

O¼Cl(cid:1)Oo þ (cid:1)CH2(cid:1) ! O¼Cl(cid:1)OH þ (cid:1)CHo(cid:1) ðkDOCÞ
(6)

After total antioxidant destruction, DOC is consumed
only by this reaction, and its local consumption rate is
given by:

d½DOC(cid:2)
dt

¼ (cid:1)kDOC½DOC(cid:2)½CH2

(cid:2) ¼ (cid:1)K½DOC(cid:2)

(7)

At reasonably low conversions (before total PE embrit-
tlement), the methylene concentration can be considered
constant, and the system behaves as a ﬁrst-order reaction
of rate constant K ¼ kDOC ½CH2(cid:2). In such cases, the depth
of reacted layer is expected to be independent of the

ing pipe processing. In ISL and CZ regions, the stabilizer
distribution seems homogeneous. The induction time in
these regions can vary between about 150 and 200 min
depending of the pipe origin.

Ageing effects can be summarized as follows: The sta-
bilizer concentration decreases in all the regions, but in a
different way in ISL and in the rest of the wall. In CZ,
practically no change is observed in a ﬁrst period of about
5 years. Then, the proﬁle remains ﬂat and undergoes a
slow translation toward low values. OSL behaves practi-
cally as CZ. If a difference in the rates of induction time
decrease exists, it is within measurement incertitudes. In
ISL, the decrease is faster, and its rate is a decreasing

In the case of DOC, ISL reaches rapidly an asymptotic
depth of the order of 1 mm, and the transition between
ISL and CZ is almost vertical, very sharp, and its depth is
practically independent of ageing conditions [19, 24]. In
the case of nondisinfected water, ISL remains undifferen-
tiated of CZ in the ﬁrst years of exposure. Then, a gradi-
ent appears, but it remains considerably less marked than
in disinfected networks. Pipes exposed in bleach-disin-
fected water have an intermediary behavior. The transition
between ISL and CZ is more progressive than with DOC,

dant concentration proﬁles must
involve two compo-
nents: The ﬁrst one dedicated to simulate physical
transport, loss processes being almost the same for DOC
and bleach. The second one, dedicated to simulate chem-
ical processes, could be signiﬁcantly different.

Let us ﬁrst consider antioxidant loss kinetics independ-
ently of chemical consumption. Evaporation kinetic laws
are generally based on two assumptions:

When the polymer is saturated by the stabilizer, the
loss rate of this latter reS (number N of stabilizer moles
lost per area and time units) is equal to the evaporation
rate of pure stabilizer,
independent of the matrix
nature.

i.e.,

Below the saturation level, the loss rate re is propor-
tional to the stabilizer concentration [AH]surf in the super-
ﬁcial layer:

re ¼ (cid:1) dN

¼ (cid:1)reS

½AH(cid:2)
½AH(cid:2)
S

surf

ðin mol=m2=sÞ

(9)

where [AH]S is the stabilizer concentration at saturation.

When evaporation controls loss kinetics (see later), the
stabilizer is homogeneously destroyed into the whole sam-
ple volume, and the stabilizer depletion in the polymer
matrix is given by:

¼ (cid:1) re

d½AH(cid:2)

(s21) is the ﬁrst-order rate constant, and

¼ (cid:1)b ½AH(cid:2)

(10)

where b ¼ reS

L is the sample thickness.

S

There are relatively abundant literature data obtained
on thin samples and showing that additive evaporation
from polyoleﬁns is effectively a ﬁrst-order process (see
for instance Ref. [28]). Lundback et al. [25, 26] con-
sider rather the loss rate re and a ‘‘rate constant’’ F0
deﬁned by:

F0 ¼ reS
½AH(cid:2)

S

¼ b L

ðin m=sÞ

(11)

These authors reported F0 values for two stabilizers of
relatively close molar masses: a thiobisphenol (Irganox
1081, M ¼ 353 g mol21) and a methylene bisphenol (Low-
inox 22M46, M ¼ 335 g mol21) in two distinct matrices:
LPE and branched PE (BPE) at 908C and 958C. They
found relative close F0 values for a given matrix, for
instance (2.1–4.5) 3 1029 m s21 in LPE, but a signiﬁcant
difference between both matrices ((3–13) 3 10210 m s21
for BPE), which seems to invalidate the ﬁrst assumption
on which evaporation kinetic law is based. These values
were obtained with a sample of 2.7 mm thickness, which
leads to b values ranging from 7.8 3 1026 to 16.7 3
1026 s21 for LPE and from 1.1 3 1027 to 4.8 3 1027 s21
for BPE.

Using a coupled transport-reaction kinetic model for
PE pipes of 3.0–4.5 mm wall thickness, used in French

where D is the coefﬁcient of reagent (here DOC) diffu-
sion.

It seems difﬁcult to conclude, from Fig. 1, whether
bleach behaves or not as DOC because the timescales of
stabilizer disappearance in ISL and CZ are not different
enough. However, it seems probable that antioxidant is
destroyed by a radical process, and it would be difﬁcult
to imagine a radical reagent that would have a so high
selectivity as
it would destroy antioxidant without
attacking PE.

Interesting observations can be made about the changes
observed in CZ and OSL. The ﬂatness of the proﬁles indi-
cates clearly that the stabilizer diffusivity is high enough,
compared with the losses at the surface, to redistribute
quasi homogeneously the stabilizer in CZ. In OSL, losses
result from evaporation and extraction by water. In Fig. 4,
the induction time in the middle of the wall, i.e., on the
plateau, was plotted against the reduced time of exposure
for all the measurements made whatever the disinfection
mode was (none, bleach, or DOC). A common kinetic
behavior clearly appears: the induction time remains ﬁrst
almost constant for a few years, and, then, it decreases in
a sigmoidal way to vanish after 18–35 years. The time to
reach the half of the initial value ranges between about 7
and 17 years. The scatter is surprisingly low if we con-
sider the variety of pipe origins, temperatures, disinfectant
natures, and concentrations.
from this
result, to made two hypotheses: First, chemical consump-
tion plays a little role in the global antioxidant loss phe-
nomenon. Second, there are very little differences in the
transport properties of the stabilizers used by the various
pipe manufacturers involved in this study.

[29] determined b and D values by an inverse approach
and found b ¼ 10210 s21 and D ¼ 9.7 3 10217 m2 s21
at 158C. The D value corresponds to a stabilizer of rela-
tively high molar mass, presumably Irganox 1010 (M ¼
1178 g mol21) for which D (cid:3) 10216 m2 s21 at 158C
[30]. Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis conﬁrmed that
the stabilizer was effectively Irganox 1010.

to 7800 m21 for the precited bisphenols at 90–958C what-
ever the PE matrix was [25, 26].

Considering the differences in molecular size and in
temperature, and the various sources of incertitude, these
values of F0/D are surprisingly close and seem to indicate
that evaporation and diffusion are governed in the same
way by the same structural factors.

A kinetic model for the diffusion–evaporation process
has been elaborated by Crank [31] and then used by Cal-
vert and Billingham in the case of polyoleﬁn–stabilizer
systems [32, 33]. A dimensionless quantity F can be
deﬁned from this theory as the ratio of diffusion and
evaporation characteristic times:

U ¼

b L2
D

¼ F0L
D

(12)

Schematically, if F (cid:4) 1, the process is diffusion con-
trolled, and there are marked concentration gradients in
the sample thickness. On the contrary, if F (cid:5) 1, the pro-
cess is evaporation controlled, and the stabilizer concen-
tration proﬁle is ﬂat. According to Calvert and Billingham
[32, 33], there would be a transition domain:

0:6 (cid:6) U (cid:6) 10

(13)

For samples of about 3 mm thickness, the values of
F0/D reported above lead to F values of the order of 10
[29] or from 13 to 21 [25, 26]. From a recent compilation
of literature data [34], we ﬁnd a relatively sharp transition
domain at F (cid:3) 15 6 4. These data carry relatively strong
incertitudes, but two clear observations can be made: For
bisphenols at 90–958C, as for Irganox 1010 at 158C, in
PE samples of about 3 mm thick, stabilizer loss is evapo-
ration controlled. However, in both cases, the system is
close to the transition between evaporation controlled and
diffusion controlled kinetic regimes.

It is too soon to generalize such a behavior, but the
results reported here seem to indicate an interesting trend:
The evaporation rate constant b and the coefﬁcient of dif-
fusion D would vary almost proportionally with the anti-
oxidant structure and the temperature of exposure. If this
trend was conﬁrmed in the future, the predominance of
diffusion or evaporation control would depend almost
exclusively of the sample thickness.

Extraction by water receives the same kinetic treat-
ment as evaporation. Extraction rate constants are

slightly higher
[24–26], but
than evaporation ones
remain of the same order of magnitude. Lundback et al.
[25, 26] have shown that extraction is faster in air than
in nitrogen-bubbled water, and explained the difference
by the fact that the stabilizer (Santonox R) is destroyed
by oxidation in water. This difference is probably a
characteristic of ageing tests made in stagnant water.
Sophisticated models have been proposed to take into
account hydrodynamic factors [35–37], but in the case
under study of drinking water networks, it can be rea-
sonably assumed that
the stabilizer concentration in
water is negligible.

For the elaboration of a kinetic model for stabilizer
physical losses, all the authors start from a ﬁrst-order law
for evaporation and Fick’s law for diffusion. The models
differ essentially by the choice of the boundary condi-
tions. For Lundback et al. [25, 26]:

where the subscript ‘‘surf’’ indicates the superﬁcial ele-

The mode of numerical computation is detailed in the

Let us now consider chemical aspects. In the case of

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons LicenseIn the case of DOC, it was assumed that it is the DOC
molecule itself, which penetrates into PE and reacts with
the stabilizer and with the polymer. In the case of chlorine
or bleach, the situation is more complicated because the
chemistry of these systems in PE matrix is not totally eluci-
dated. It is well known that, in water, three main strongly
oxidizing species can be formed: Cl2 which predominates
at pH < 3, ClO2 which predominates at pH [ 7.5, and
ClOH which predominates at 3 < pH < 7.5 [38]. These
species coexist with other ions: Cl2, HO2, and ClO3
2, and
with radicals, especially HO8 and ClO8. In dark, when it is
present, Cl2 can slowly dissociate into Cl8 radicals. Two
factors impose a certain selectivity to these systems: the pH
of water as seen above and the PE impermeability to ions.
As a matter of fact, the very low polarity of PE disfavours
the dissolution of highly polar species such as water and, a
fortiori, ions. Among the remaining possible species, two
have been envisaged: chlorine and hydroxyl radicals. Chlo-
rine was considered as the reactive species by Gandek et al.
[35], Dear and Mason [39], and Mittelman et al. [37]. As
reported above, dichlorine must be present only in acidic
media, and it must be totally absent or in a very low con-
centration in drinking water. Furthermore, it is expected to
be a reactive species through its dissociation into Cl8 radi-
cals. This reaction is very slow in dark and could eventually
be the rate-controlling step in the process of stabilizer
destruction. Chlorine will be, thus, kept as candidate for re-
active species only if
there is no better alternative.
Hydroxyl radicals formation would result from a mecha-
nism proposed by Holst [40]:

ClOH þ ClO(cid:1) ! ClOo þ Cl(cid:1) þ HOo

HOo þ ClO(cid:1) ! ClOo þ HO(cid:1)

ClOo þ ClO(cid:1) þ HO(cid:1) ! 2Cl(cid:1) þ O2 þ HOo

(20)

(21)

(22)

Their formation is thus favored in the domain of ClOH
and ClO2 coexistence, i.e., essentially at pH ¼ 7.5 6 1.5
[38], which largely coincides with the pH domain of drink-
ing water. Several authors have assumed that polymer deg-
radation in the presence of disinfectants is essentially due
to HO8 radicals [41–44]. However, HO8 radicals are
extremely reactive, even with saturated alkanes as PE. They
are, thus, expected to be consumed in a very thin superﬁcial
layer, probably of micrometric thickness or thinner. The
assumption of reaction with HO8 radicals seems to us difﬁ-
cult to reconcile with the observed depth of stabilizer chem-
ical attack ((cid:3)0.5 mm). However, as for chlorine, we lack of
quantitative arguments to reject it deﬁnitively.

ClO8 radicals seem to us the best candidates. They are
formed in the same pH interval as HO8 radicals, and they
are many orders of magnitude less reactive, so that they
could eventually explain the observed stabilizer concen-
tration proﬁles in ISL.

There is a long way before the elaboration of a kinetic
model for stabilizer loss in the presence of bleach-disin-

fected water. Future research on this topic must involve the
following steps:

1. Identify unequivocally the reactive species, essentially
from comparative studies of model systems. Chlorine
can be generated in gas phase, hydroxyl radicals can
be generated from hydrogen peroxide, etc.

2. Determine the concentration of

reactive species in
water for the conditions (temperature, pH, and bleach
concentration) under study.

3. Determine the solubility of reactive species in PE,
which is a challenging objective for species such as
HO8 and ClO8. It will be perhaps necessary to estimate
this solubility by theoretical methods.

4. Determine the diffusivity of reactive species in PE.
Estimations can be made from comparisons;
for
instance, ClO8 is presumably intermediary between Cl2
and O2 of which the diffusivities are known.

5. Determine the rate constants of stabilizer and PE reac-
tions with the reactive species. If the above physical
parameters are known with a sufﬁcient precision, rate
constants can be determined from stabilizer concentra-
tion proﬁles using an inverse approach [29].

CONCLUSIONS

Stabilizer concentration proﬁles in the wall thickness of
PE pipes exposed to water disinfected by bleach have been
determined for pipes used in the French network of drinking
water for durations up to 18 years. Comparisons with results
obtained, in the same period, in network parts not disinfected
or disinfected by DOC lead to the following observations:

Most of the stabilizer loss is due to physical processes, i.e.,
diffusion–evaporation, mainly in evaporation-controlled kinetic
regime. This part of the stabilizer loss, predominant in CZ and
OSL, i.e., in 2/3 to 3/4 of the whole pipe wall thickness, is
almost independent of the disinfectant nature. Modeling of this
component can be performed using a ﬁrst-order kinetic law for
evaporation and Fick’s law for diffusion. Results obtained on
strongly different systems (bisphenols at 90–958C or Irganox
1010 at 158C) seem to indicate that the ratio between evapora-
tion rate constant and diffusion coefﬁcient undergoes only
slight variations from a stabilizer to another and from a temper-
ature to another. This result needs, however, to be conﬁrmed.

To conclude about physical loss, we are not very far
from a reliable model to predict antioxidant concentration
proﬁles in CZ and OSL. In ISL, the stabilizer is destroyed
by reaction with the disinfectant or a reaction product of
this latter. Bleach attacks the stabilizer, but at a rate consid-
erably lower than DOC. In samples of 3.0–4.5 mm thick-
ness, stabilizer has not totally disappeared in the superﬁcial
layer (of 0.5 mm thick) after 18 years of exposure, so that it
is impossible to appreciate the rate of an eventual disinfect-
ant–PE reaction contrarily to the case of DOC.

The chemistry of bleach–PE interaction is not totally
understood. Several assumptions have been examined, but
a supplementary research is needed to fully elucidate the
mechanisms and to elaborate a suitable kinetic model.

Let us discretize the pipe wall (of thickness L (cid:3) some
mm) into a high number of thin elemental layers (of typi-
cal thickness Dz (cid:3) some lm). Let us consider a given
elemental layer (i) located at the depth z beneath the inner
(IS, z ¼ 0) or outer surface (OS, z ¼ L). At least three
different cases can be distinguished, and are schematized
in Figs. A1–A3: Case (a) represents antioxidant transport
by diffusion in CZ; case (b) represents antioxidant trans-
port by diffusion plus evaporation (or water extraction) at
IS or OS; and case (c) represents antioxidant transport by
diffusion at IS or OS coated by an impermeable layer.

In each case,

the global stabilizer ﬂux density J
(expressed in mol m22 s21) crossing the median plane of the
elemental layer (i) is the algebraic sum of two opposite ele-
mental ﬂux densities: one Jþ in the arbitrarily chosen direc-
tion of stabilizer diffusion (to the left) and, thus, crossing the
boundary (2) separating the elemental layers (i 2 1) and (i),
and the other J2 in the opposite direction to antioxidant dif-
fusion (to the right) and, thus, crossing the boundary (þ) sep-
arating the elemental layers (i) and (i þ 1).

where ni is the number of moles of stabilizer molecules
crossing the median plane (i) and S the surface of the me-

ﬂux density leads to:
