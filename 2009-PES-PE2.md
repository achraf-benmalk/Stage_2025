This article deals with the failure of polyethylene pipes
transporting chlorine dioxide (DOC) disinfected water
under pressures of few bars. Accelerated aging tries
made at 20 or 408C show that the antioxidant is rapidly
consumed in a superﬁcial layer until a depth of about
1.2 mm. Carbonyl groups appear in a sharper layer of
few hundreds micrometers. Natural aging results at vari-
ous places, for various times up to about 30 years,
reveal also a superﬁcial attack with a depth of the order
of 1.2 mm. An antioxidant loss by migration, in the whole
sample thickness, is also observable. The shape of anti-
oxidant concentration proﬁles indicates that the cross-
ing of interfaces controls partially the whole migration
kinetics. Failures, with brittle cracking, were observed in
natural aging, after exposure times of the order of 5–
15 years, i.e., far before the expected lifetime (50 years).
A kinetic model has been elaborated to predict the time
to failure. It is based on a chemical unit, which models
the radical processes induced by DOC, and a mechani-
cal unit based on an empirical creep law and a failure
criterion depending of the molar mass calculated by the
chemical unit. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 49:1642–1652, 2009. ª 2009

INTRODUCTION

This article deals with the effect of chlorine dioxide
(DOC) on aging of polyethylene (PE) pipes for the trans-
port of drinking water under pressure. In the ﬁrst part of this

article [1], it has been shown that DOC, which is a free rad-
ical, is able to initiate radical chain oxidation in PE. Oxida-
tion induces random chain scission and this latter leads to
embrittlement when the weight average molar mass MW
becomes typically lower than 70 kg mol21. A mechanistic
scheme, based on previously established one for low-tem-
perature PE thermo-oxidation [2, 3] incorporating DOC
reactions, has been built [1]. In the chosen accelerated
aging conditions, (high-DOC concentrations), the role of
antioxidants was considered negligible owing to their very
high-reactivity with DOC and the low sample thickness
favoring DOC diffusion. The case of pipe natural aging is,
indeed, more complex, ﬁrst because DOC concentrations
are 100–1000 times lower (typically 0.1–0.2 ppm in drink-
ing water), second because pipe degradation is presumably
diffusion controlled, owing to the relatively high wall thick-
ness (few millimeters). Then, kinetic modeling needs to
take into account antioxidant reactions, and the diffusion of
molecular reactive species: oxygen, antioxidant, and DOC.
The ﬁrst objective of this work is to complete the ki-
netic model presented in the ﬁrst part of this article [1],
incorporating the above factors. The primary function of
this model is to predict the change of molar mass in the
superﬁcial layer at the polymer/water interface, because it
is the direct cause of premature crack initiation. The
model allows to predict many other chemical quantities
among which two are especially interesting:
the depth
proﬁle of carbonyl groups concentration and the depth
proﬁle of stabilizer concentration. As a matter of fact,
both proﬁles are experimentally checkable from routine
methods and offer thus two especially pertinent ways for

POLYMER ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE—-2009

the model validation. At this state, the model would be
able, in principle, to predict the pipe embrittlement in its
superﬁcial layer in contact with disinfected water, i.e., the
time at which this latter would loose its ability to sustain
plastic deformations [4]. But for users, what is important
is to predict the time to failure under pressure.

The second objective of this work is to explore a semi-
empirical way to model the ‘‘chemical–mechanical cou-
pling’’ responsible for pipe fracture in use conditions. In
practice,
lifetime prediction of pipes under pressure is
based on two principles [5–7]:

‘‘Regression’’ plots: Log(hoop stress r) ¼ f[Log(time

to failure tF)] are linear in certain stress-time intervals.

The temperature dependence of tF can be represented
by Arrhenius law. In other words, it is possible to con-
struct a regression master plot using adequate Arrhenius
shift factors [5].

In isothermal plots, one, two, or three kinetic regimes of
fracture can be observed, depending on the observation
time, polymer structure, or environment reactivity, as sche-
matized in Fig. 1 [6]. In the absence of chemical degrada-
tion (no change of molar mass distribution), two regimes: I
and II (or eventually only one: I in cross-linked PE pipes [8]
and perhaps in the last linear PE generation PE100) can be
observed. It is usual to consider that regime I corresponds to
ductile failure although, at least in cross-linked PE pipes,
brittle failure can also occur in regime I at low-stress values
[8]. This regime is characterized by a low-slope: D(Log r)/
D(Log tF) (cid:1) 0.03. Regime II corresponds always to brittle
regime. Here, D(Log r)/D(Log tF) (cid:1) 0.3. The dashed arrow
in Fig. 1a indicates the sense of variation of the transition
time tC from one PE generation to the next one. The same
ﬁgure indicates the range of the use hoop stresses (typically
less than 1 MPa). The minimum lifetime (tm in Fig. 1a) is
expected to be about 50 years. Regime III corresponds to
chemical ageing. The corresponding straight line is almost
vertical: the incertitude on the determination of its parame-
ters is thus very high. Regime III can totally supplant regime
II (Fig. 1c) when the environment is especially reactive.
This is the case, apparently, of certain portions of the DOC
disinfected water network which failed after a few years ex-
posure, in the south of France, especially in the dog-days of
2003. The regression analysis is not well adapted, to our
opinion, to lifetime prediction in regime III, at least because

each regression graph corresponds only to one environment
composition and because physical and chemical failures do
not necessary obey to the same time-temperature superposi-
tion principles, that complicates seriously the analysis. It
seemed to us interesting to develop a new kinetic model
based on the following principles:

It must predict failure in function of the following
parameters: PE initial MW value, cristallinity ratio, antiox-
idant nature, and concentration, temperature, water pres-
sure, DOC concentration.

It must be designed to work as well in isothermal as in
anisothermal conditions (to take into account seasonal
temperature variations).

It must predict fracture as well in regime II as in regime

III (regime I is ignored owing to its low-practical interest).

It must predict experimentally accessible characteris-
tics, for instance carbonyl and stabilizer concentration
proﬁles, molar mass in the superﬁcial layer, grafted chlo-
rine content, to permit its validation.

EXPERIMENTAL

Materials

All the samples under study were black polyethylene
pipes for the transport of drinking water, obeying the
French standard: NF EN 12201. They had the following
features: 2.0–2.5% by weight of carbon black; a melting
point: Tm ¼ 120–1308C; a crystallinity ratio: XC ¼ 35–
50%; a weight average molar mass: MW ¼ 100–150 kg
mol21; an oxidation induction time at 1908C: ti ¼ 155–
180 min. The pipe diameters ranged between 30 and
63 mm,
thickness was between 3.0 and
7.0 mm.

the pipe wall

Pipe sections having ages ranging from 1 to 30 years
were taken in the drinking water network in various pla-
ces of the south of France. All the samples except two
were taken in network parts where chlorine dioxide
(DOC) was used as disinfectant. Two samples were taken
in a network part, in Alp Mountains, where no disinfect-
ant was used. About 130 samples, taken in more than 50
distinct places, were studied. Certain samples displayed
open brittle cracks, others displayed no visible damage.

FIG. 1. Shape of usual regression curves.

Control samples made of ‘‘pure’’ PE with the same
antioxidant, in the same concentration, as in sample A,
were prepared and their OIT was determined. Its value:
158 min is very closed to the one of sample A, showing
that carbon black plays a negligible stabilizing role in the
conditions under study.

As it will be shown,

the induction period vanishes
totally after aging, in the superﬁcial layer where DOC
penetrates, whereas there is no sign of carbon black
destruction.

Phosphite costabilizers are known to act essentially
through ionic processes [9] and to work essentially at
high-temperature, in processing conditions.

According to the above hypotheses, if [AH]0 and [AH]
are the phenol concentration values, respectively, before
exposure and after an exposure of duration t where the
induction time, initially ti0, has decreased to a value ti,
one would have [10, 11] the following:

RESULTS

Induction Time Proﬁles After Accelerated Aging

Some induction time proﬁles obtained at 408C for vari-
ous exposure times and DOC concentrations are shown in
Fig. 3. The antioxidant consumption in a superﬁcial layer
increases with time for a given DOC concentration and
with DOC concentration for a given exposure time. The
‘‘front’’ of DOC attack is almost vertical. It tends toward
a pseudo-asymptotic depth of the order of 1.2 mm when
exposure time increases. The stabilizer concentration
remains unchanged, within experimental incertitudes, in
the core of the pipe wall. No antioxidant consumption
was observed when pipe samples were exposed in DOC
free water in the same exposure conditions.

FIG. 3. Oxidation induction time proﬁles after exposure at 408C in sol-
utions with different DOC concentrations as follows: (a) after 99 days in
dematerialized water; (b) after 2 days in 5 ppm; (c) after 10 days in 31.8
ppm; (d) after 51 days in 66.8 ppm; (e) after 99 days in 68.5 ppm.

FIG. 2. Schematization of pipe machining to obtain (cid:1)0.5 mm-thick
slabs.

A pipe of 40 mm diameter, 4.5 mm wall thickness,
named sample A in the following, was chosen for acceler-
ated aging tests. It displayed the following initial charac-
teristics: 2.5% by weight of carbon black; a melting point:
Tm ¼ 1308C; a crystallinity ratio: XC ¼ 45%; a weight
average molar mass: MW ¼ 350 kg mol21; and an oxida-
tion induction time at 1908C: ti ¼ 165 min. It is stabilized
by a classical antioxidant mixture: 0.1% by weight of
Irganox 1010 plus 0.05% by weight of Irgafos 168. The
presence of secondary antioxidant of the phosphite-type
was conﬁrmed by elemental analysis.

Accelerated Aging

A pipe section of (cid:1)100 cm length was placed on a
thermostated loop in which a controlled DOC solution
was put in circulation at 20 or 408C at atmospheric pres-
sure. DOC was periodically titrated and its concentration
readjusted at its initial value. DOC solutions were pro-
duced by reaction of chlorite anion with chlorhydric acid
in stoichiometric excess. The global reaction can be sum-
marized as follows:

5 NaClO2 þ 4 HCl ! 4 ClO2 þ 5 NaCl þ 2 H2O

The excess of chlorhydric acid increases the reaction yield.
DOC concentrations ranging from 1 to 100 ppm were
studied. The pipe samples were exposed up to 20 weeks.
Preliminary tests showed that aging characteristics are
almost independent of the PE origin, the water pH, and
the scaling character of water.

Carbonyl and Antioxidant Thickness Proﬁles

Pipes were machined and slabs of 0.5 mm thick were
taken at various depths according to the scheme of Fig. 2.
The slabs were analyzed by IR spectrophotometry in Atte-
nuated Total Reﬂectance mode, essentially to record the
carbonyl peak at (cid:1)1720 cm21.

Samples of 5–10 mg, taken in slabs, were analyzed by
DSC to determine the oxidation induction time (OIT) at
1908C in an oxygen ﬂow of 50 mL min21. It will be con-
sidered that OIT changes are essentially due to the pheno-
lic antioxidant consumption, for the following reasons:

Carbonyl Proﬁles After Accelerated Aging

A carbonyl proﬁle obtained after 99 days of exposure
in a 66.5 ppm DOC solution at 408C is shown in Fig. 4,
where it is superimposed to the corresponding induction
time proﬁle. Carbonyls appear in a superﬁcial layer of
few hundreds micrometers, thinner than the antioxidant
consumption layer. As shown in the ﬁrst part of this arti-
cle [1], DOC induces PE oxidation but, here, this latter is
diffusion controlled.

Induction Time Proﬁles After Natural Aging

Some characteristic induction proﬁles are presented in

Fig. 5. These results call for the following comments:

Comparison between disinfected and non disinfected
water shows that the superﬁcial antioxidant consumption
near the inner pipe surface is clearly due to DOC attack.

The depth of the ‘‘antioxidant consumption layer’’ is
not very different
to
another. It is also close to the one observed after acceler-
ated aging, i.e., of the order of 1.2 mm.

from one location or one age,

Contrarily to the case of accelerated aging, the induction
time decreases in the core of the pipe wall, as a result of
antioxidant physical loss. The induction time in the middle
of the wall ti (L/2) has been plotted against exposure time
in Fig. 6. Except for some cases of anomalously short life-
time, the points are located between two boundaries corre-
sponding to characteristic times between about 10 and
20 years, the characteristic time being deﬁned as the time
to reach an induction time value of about 50 min. There is
no difference, from this criterion, between DOC disinfected
and nondisinfected water, showing that the antioxidant con-
centration decrease in the middle of the wall is effectively
due to physical migration.

In the outer wall half, the proﬁle remains almost hori-
zontal. This is not the case at high-temperature ((cid:1)1008C)
aging, where the antioxidant concentration is maximum
near the middle of the wall and zero at the outer surface
[7, 11–13]. The observed proﬁle indicates that, in natural
aging conditions, i.e., close to ambient temperature, the

The numbers in the ﬁgure indicate the pipe age in years. All the pipes
have been used with DOC disinfected water except one used with non-
disinfected water (dashed line).

antioxidant loss is, at least partly, governed by its evapo-
ration rate.

Time to Failure in Natural Aging

For about two dozens of samples, the exposure condi-
tions (pressure, temperature) and the time to failure were
known with a reasonable approximation. The results have
been put in a regression plot (log(r) ¼ f[log(tF)]), in Fig. 7
where Brown and Lu data [5], corrected for a temperature
of 158C, were added. The times to failure are at least one
order of magnitude lower than the ones predicted from
regression analysis in the case of disinfectant free water.

KINETIC MODEL

The aim of the kinetic model is to predict the time to

failure tF. It is based on the following principles:

Fracture is due to the polymer creep. The extent of this
latter is characterized by an undeﬁned parameter e which
could be the overall strain, the anelastic strain, the local

Thus, our ‘‘mechanical model’’ contains not less, not more
information than ‘‘regression’’ straight lines. Indeed, the pa-
rameter values must be adjusted to agree with ‘‘regression’’
data on pipes tested in the absence of chemical degradation.
eF depends on the polymer molar mass and thus, decreases
with the conversion of the chemical degradation process.
The fracture process is schematized by Fig. 8.

According to the above hypotheses, the effect of aging
on regression plots could be schematized by Fig. 9. Only
regime (II) is considered. According to our hypothesis,
creep kinetics is not modiﬁed by chemical aging, but the
‘‘creep extent’’ at rupture eF decreases. This means that, if
(IIu) corresponds to the regression straight
line of the
undegraded polymer, it is translated toward short times in
(IIt) after a certain aging time. For a hoop stress r, frac-
ture will occur at the point A of abscissa tF1. Let us now
consider a try made at the hoop stress r 2 Dr. If degra-
dation was stopped at time tF1, then fracture would occur
at point A0 of abscissa tF2. However, degradation contin-
ues at times longer than tF1 so that the regression straight
line is again shifted toward short times. Then, fracture
occurs in point B of abscissa tF3 when it crosses the hori-
zontal straight line of ordinate r 2 Dr.

There is basically no reason to suppose that the enve-
lope of fracture points, passing by A and B, would be a
straight line, however, since it is quasi vertical, it will
practically appear as a straight line (regime III).

The link between this mechanical model and a chemical
kinetic model can be established on the basis of the follow-

FIG. 8. Schematization of the changes of ‘‘creep extent’’ e and its criti-
cal value eF with time under pressure. The slope changes could be due
for instance to seasonal temperature variations (w: winter, s: summer).
eFF and tFF correspond to exposure in the absence of disinfectant. The
corresponding value tFF is available in literature for isothermal tests. eFD
and tFD correspond to exposure in the presence of disinfectant.

In regime II, fracture occurs at constant ‘‘creep extent’’ eF.

ily characterized by a given type of morphology with close
values of lamellar dimensions. Samples signiﬁcantly differ-
ent from the point of view of morphology, for instance
copolymers of very different compositions, are expected to
have distinct parameters values. Equation 3 can be rewrit-

One expects that cracks initiate and propagate easily in
the degraded superﬁcial zone where the weight average
molar mass is typically MW (cid:5) 70 kg mol21 [19].

According to the basic principle of fracture mechanics,
pipe fracture can occur if the ‘‘primary cracks’’ have a
length higher than a certain critical value lC [20]. Previous
investigations seem to show that for PE, lC could be of the
order of 100 lm [21]. It is thus proposed to take the MW
value at a 100 lm depth to use in Eq. 7. This value (as the
whole MW thickness proﬁle) can be predicted from the
coupled diffusion-reaction model (see below).

Diffusion-reaction coupling is incorporated into the

chemical kinetic model as follows:

@2½Y(cid:2)
@z2

Three reactive molecular species susceptible of migrate
through the pipe wall are considered: oxygen, phenolic
antioxidant, and DOC. Each one is characterized by its
diffusion coefﬁcient DO2 for O2, DAH for the antioxidant,
and DDOC for DOC. A Fickian term: DY
is added to
each differential equation expressing the concentration
changes of the species under consideration, and the whole
system of differential equations is solved in each elemen-
tary layer dz keeping a local diffusion-reaction coupling
and using a semi-implicit Rosenbrock’s algorithm [22].
The resulting differential equations are reported in Appen-
dix. Literature values are used for DO2 [23] and for DAH
[24]. DDOC is obtained using experimental
results of
accelerated aging tries (see below), using an inverse
method [25]. Its Arrhenius parameters and its value at
158C are given in Table 2.

For stabilizer transport, interface crossing is a partially
rate controlling process, that leads to consider the follow-
ing boundary conditions [26, 27]:

ing considerations: The decrease of eF, i.e., the shift of the
regime II straight line, is linked to the molar mass decrease.
Various physical interpretations are available in the litera-
ture, for instance: chain disentanglement in the amorphous
phase [14], destruction of tie-macromolecules [15–17], or
rupture of craze ﬁbrils [6]. It will be assumed that, whatever
the true mechanism, the molecular weight dependence of
fracture time can be approximated by a power law:

a could be in principle determined on experiments in
pipes differing by their molar mass distribution in the ab-

will use the well-known rheological exponent as follows:

All the other parameters can be in principle determined
from available experimental data, for instance Brown’s
regression plots [5]. The values used in the chosen exam-
ple of lifetime prediction for an isothermal exposure at
158C are given in Table 1.

A chemical kinetic model aimed to predict the local
(at a given distance z of the polymer/water interface)
value of MW has been presented in Part 1 of this article.
However, as it will be shown below, degradation is diffu-
sion controlled, that leads to the existence of molar mass
thickness gradients. These latter can be taken into
account, in the mechanical model, as follows:

L21 [24]. For the diffusion coefﬁcient, a literature value:
DAH ¼ 9.7 10217 m2 s21 [24] was used.
Interface
exchange coefﬁcients b0 and bL were determined from
the stabilizer concentration proﬁles of samples aged for
13 and 15.5 years in disinfectant free water (Fig. 10).
Their Arrhenius parameters and their values at 158C are
given in Table 2.

In the case of accelerated aging, experimentally deter-
mined DOC concentrations and temperatures were used to
simulate antioxidant concentration proﬁles (Fig. 3) and
carbonyl proﬁles (Fig. 4). In these cases, since no pres-
sure is applied, no fracture is observed, even at relatively
high-degradation degrees of the wall superﬁcial layer. A
simulation of
the antioxidant concentration proﬁles is
shown in Fig. 11 where they can be compared with exper-
imental ones. In the case of natural aging, simulations
were made for pipe wall thicknesses varying from 3.0 to
4.5 mm. Some simulated proﬁles can be compared with
experimental ones in Fig. 12. Small variations of the
DOC concentration can exist from one place to another,
calculations were made for a concentration of 0.15 ppm,
which can be considered as a reasonable average value
according to water suppliers. Simulations were made for
two extreme temperatures: 9 and 248C and for a medium
temperature 158C, which is probably close to the average
temperature in most cases. The corresponding curves
Log(r) ¼ f[Log(tF)] are plotted in the regression graph of
Fig. 7. It can be observed that all the experimental points
are located between both extreme curves and are close to
the average one.

DISCUSSION

Let us ﬁrst consider the secondary functions of the
model, i.e., mainly stabilizer and carbonyl thickness pro-
ﬁles. Their prediction is interesting ﬁrst because they can

The experimentally checkable quantities, i.e., antioxi-
dant and carbonyl proﬁles are especially interesting because
they allow, at least partially, the model validation.

EXAMPLES OF SIMULATION

All the simulations have been made for a polyethylene
sample of initial average molar mass Mn0 ¼ 75 kg mol21
and MW0 ¼ 150 kg mol21. The phenolic antioxidant is
the widely used Irganox 1010 of which the functionality
is nAH ¼ 4. Its concentration was taken equal to the equi-

The antioxidant appears thus 1500 times more reactive
than PE with moderately reactive radicals, that explains
why antioxidant is rapidly destroyed by DOC.

Let us now consider antioxidant proﬁles in the case of
natural aging. Their most striking features are as follows:
The existence of a quasi asymptotic depth of DOC
penetration, practically the same ((cid:6)1.2 mm) as in acceler-
ated aging.

The fact that the concentration proﬁle displays an hori-
zontal plateau in the middle and outer wall parts, of
which the height decreases with exposure duration. It is
clear that antioxidant migration is negligible in the time-
scale of accelerated aging tests (less than 1 year), but
becomes noticeable in the case of exposure durations of
several years. Almost all the stabilizer has disappeared, in
most cases, after 20 years approximately.

The ﬂatness of the plateau in the middle and outer
parts of the wall brings interesting information: It indi-
cates that the interface exchange at both sides of the wall
controls practically the antioxidant transport kinetics, oth-
erwise, the proﬁles would have a parabolic shape, with a
maximum in the middle, and a zero concentration at the
edges, as observed in the case of high-temperature (70–
1058C) testing [28]. This seems to indicate that, in the
case under study, high-temperature exposure is not a good
accelerated aging method.

The fact that the depth of the DOC penetration front
tends toward a quasi asymptotic value z! at long time
and that z! seems to be almost independent of aging con-
ditions (in a relatively sharp temperature interval but with
strong variations of
the DOC concentration), can be
explained on the basis of a simpliﬁed theory of diffusion
controlled aging processes [29]. According to this theory,
in the case where the mobile reactive species is consumed
in a ﬁrst-order process of rate constant K, the equilibrium
depth z! of the reacted superﬁcial layer is given by a
simple scaling law as follows:

z1 ¼

(cid:3) (cid:4)1=2

D
K

(12)

where D is the diffusion coefﬁcient of the reactive species.
It is noteworthy that z! is independent of the reactant
concentration. Here, indeed, DOC is consumed by a sec-
ond-order process as follows:

DOC þ PH ! products

ðk1SÞ

where PH is polyethylene.

The consumption of DOC by reactions with the antiox-
idant is negligible since this latter has disappeared in the
superﬁcial layer before the stabilization of the penetration
front. The DOC consumption rate is thus given by the
following:

be considered as good validation criteria for the chemical
kinetic model.

Let us ﬁrst consider antioxidant proﬁles in the case of
accelerated aging. Their most striking features are, no
doubt, the abrupt shape of the DOC ‘‘penetration front’’
and the fact that the location of this latter tends toward a
quasi asymptotic depth z! of the order of 1.2 mm at long
exposure times. Both characteristics are well predicted by
the model. The apparent stabilization of the DOC ‘‘pene-
tration front’’ would be difﬁcult to explain only with the
DOC-antioxidant reaction. As a matter of fact, when the
antioxidant has totally disappeared in a superﬁcial layer,
there is no obstacle to DOC penetration in deeper zones.
The simplest explanation is that DOC penetration is con-
trolled by its reaction with PE. This reaction is consider-
ably slower than the DOC-antioxidant reaction:

However, PH is slowly consumed so that, in the conver-
sion range of practical interest:

½PH(cid:2) (cid:6) ½PH(cid:2)0 ¼ constant

(14)

The process appears thus as a pseudo-ﬁrst-order process
of rate constant:

by reactions with DOC to play a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on
polymer oxidation. In the region where DOC penetrates,
DOC-PE reactions play the predominant role in the initia-
tion of oxidation radical chains. This case of ‘‘extrinsic
initiation’’ is not very different of the case of radiochemi-
cal aging where, also,
the low-stabilizing efﬁciency of
phenolic stabilizers has been put in evidence [30].

K ¼ k1S½PH(cid:2)

(15)

Application of the above scaling law explains thus the
invariance of the asymptotic depth of the DOC penetra-
tion front. Indeed, z! would probably undergo signiﬁcant
from 208C,
changes
temperatures very different
because D and K have probably different activation ener-
gies.

at

Carbonyl proﬁles are considerably narrower than DOC
penetration ones, as predicted by the model. Since, as
seen in Part 1 of this article, chain scission is mainly due
to oxidation processes, the molar mass proﬁle is expected
to have a shape similar to carbonyl one. No doubt, the
cause of embrittlement and failure is situated in the rela-
tively sharp oxidized layer of few hundred micrometers.

Let us now consider the primary function of the model,
i.e., the prediction of time to failure tF. The model seems
to predict the good order of magnitude of tF in natural
aging conditions, which is encouraging. Indeed, the pre-
diction lacks of precision, ﬁrst because local exposure
conditions were known very approximately and were
averaged to make a calculation in isothermal,
isobaric
conditions. Indeed, the question which comes in mind is
as follows: Is it
interesting to use a so sophisticated
model only to appreciate orders of magnitude? It can be
answered that: Since the model starts from a rate expres-
sion: e(cid:3) ¼ f ðr; T; tÞ, it can work in nonisothermal, noniso-
baric conditions provided that the stress r ¼ f(t) and the
temperature T ¼ g(t) variations are known. It is notewor-
thy that regression equations Log(r) ¼ f[Log(tF)] cannot
offer this possibility. Thus, if, in a more or less remote
future, local variations of temperature, pressure and DOC
concentration are recorded,
the precision on lifetime
determination will be increased. Indeed, accelerated aging
tries under pressure at constant
temperature and DOC
concentration would constitute a good validation way for
the model. Unfortunately, they were not possible in the
frame of this study. In the case where the local recording
of exposure conditions would be economically impossible,
it can be envisaged to complete this model, which is fully
deterministic, by a probabilistic unit built from the statis-
tical analysis of natural aging results. Such tools have
been developed in other contexts and could be adapted to
the case under study.

This model is not only a lifetime prediction tool, it can
the trends of inﬂuence of the
be also used to predict
numerous operating parameters. Let us, for instance, con-
sider the effect of antioxidant: The model predicts that it
is practically inoperative because it is too fastly consumed

CONCLUSIONS

A kinetic model aimed to predict the time to failure of
PE pipes transporting drinking water disinfected by chlo-
rine dioxide has been made. It is composed of two units
as follows:

A chemical unit in which radical processes induced by
DOC and oxygen are taken into account. Reaction-diffu-
sion coupling is simulated to predict thickness concentra-
tion proﬁles of reactive species and reaction products.
Three diffusing reactive species are considered as follows:
DOC, oxygen, and the phenolic antioxidant. The main
function of the model is to predict the molar mass MW
value in the superﬁcial layer at the polymer/water inter-
face, because its decrease is the cause of embrittlement.

The mechanical unit is based on an empirical creep
equation associated to a failure criterion. The creep rate
depends essentially of time,
temperature, and pressure.
The failure criterion depends on weight average molar
mass, which is given by the chemical unit.

The model parameters were identiﬁed from accelerated
aging tests made at high DOC concentrations at 20 and
408C on unloaded samples, and from natural aging tests
on loaded samples. The model predicts the good order of
magnitude for the time to failure in natural aging condi-
tions. Its precision is very limited owing to the incerti-
tudes on local aging parameters (temperature, pressure,
DOC concentration). But, the model predicts satisfyingly
certain trends, relative fort instance to antioxidant or car-
bonyl concentration proﬁles or to the lack of inﬂuence of
antioxidants. It is thus not only a prediction tool but also
an analysis tool allowing to express the inﬂuence of the
numerous operative parameters into a mathematical form.
It appears that DOC, which is a radical in ground state, is
reactive with phenolic antioxidants and with polyethylene.
It is able to initiate oxidation radical processes leading to
is responsible for polymer
chain scission. This latter
embrittlement and premature failure. In natural aging condi-
tions (temperature (cid:6) 158C, DOC concentration (cid:6) 0.15 ppm,
hoop stress of few MPa), lifetimes can be of the order of
10 years, sometimes shorter, against 50 years expected
value.
