Towards a Non Empirical Kinetic Model for the
Lifetime Prediction of Polyethylene Pipes
Transporting Drinking Water

Xavier Colin,* Ludmila Audouin, Jacques Verdu

Summary: A kinetic model has been elaborated to predict the lifetime of poly-
ethylene pipes transporting slightly pressurized (3–12 bars) drinking water disinfected
by free radical reagents. This model is composed of three levels: i) A system of
differential equations, derived from a mechanistic scheme for radical chain oxidation
in the presence of free radical reagents, giving access to the spatial distribution (in
the pipe wall) of oxidation products and stabilizer concentration;
ii) Equations
allowing to predict the proﬁles of average molar masses from the spatial distribution
of chain scissions and crosslinking events; iii) An empirical creep equation and a
failure criterion derived from regression curves obtained in pure water (without
disinfectant). It is assumed that the chemical degradation modiﬁes only the time to
transition between ductile and brittle regimes of failure, and that this time is linked
to the weight average molar mass according to the classical power law. By super-
imposing these three levels, it is possible to predict the time to failure under the
coupled effects of pressure and chemical degradation. This model is successfully
applied to the case of chlorine dioxide.

Introduction

It is well known that polyethylene (PE) pipes
transporting slightly pressurized water
undergo failure after a time tF which is a
decreasing function of pressure p and
temperature T. Laboratory isothermal and
isobaric experiments aimed to establish the
dependence of tF with T and p, are usually
translated into (log s–log tF) regression
plots, s being the hoop stress. Starting from
in certain (s, tF)
the observation that,
domains,
these plots are quasi-linear,
international standards propose to charac-
terize the material by the equations of the
corresponding straightlines [e.g. NFT 54091

(AFNOR)]. In the case of a PE generation
anterior to the PE 80 one, three kinetic
regimes corresponding to three distinct
straightlines were put in evidence.
By
watching the graph from the highest to the
lowest stresses (i.e. from the shortest to the
longest lifetimes), one can distinguish: The
ductile regime (I) (m ¼ d(log s)/d(log tF) (cid:1)
0.03); The ‘‘physical’’ brittle regime (II)
obtained in the absence of chemical degra-
dation (m (cid:1) 0.3); and the ‘‘chemical’’ brittle
regime (III) involving a chemical degrada-
tion of the polymer (m (cid:2) 0.3). The differ-
ences between regimes (II) and (III) can be
established from molar mass measure-
ments. Indeed, the molar mass distribution
is not affected in regime (II), whereas it is
shifted towards low values in regime (III). If
the chemical degradation is fast enough,
regime (III) can totally supplant regime (II)
(Figure 1).

Water is non reactive with PE, but it
contains generally two reactive species:

conditions on water distribution networks
(under 3–12 bars of water pressure, at
15 8C), but in the absence of disinfectant,
the ‘‘chemical lifetime’’ is longer than the
‘‘physical aging lifetime’’ tC and regime (II)
becomes the predominant mode of failure.
The time to failure tF is higher than 50 years,
that seems to satisfy entirely practitioners.
In this case, various mechanical/physical
approaches have been proposed for lifetime
prediction.

However, disinfectants, especially chlor-
ine derivatives, are known to destroy
organic compounds by free radical pro-
cesses.
true that PE presents a
relatively high chemical stability, but zero
radical
reactivity would be surprising
because radical reactions are never totally
selective. Moreover, PE contains antiox-
idants, generally hindered phenols, which
are very sensitive to radical processes.
Disinfectants are thus expected to shorten
PE pipe lifetime, at least by accelerating the
antioxidants consumption. This latter has
been clearly put in evidence from experi-
mentally established antioxidants concen-
tration proﬁles. Antioxidants are consumed
more rapidly in the presence than in the
absence of disinfectant in water, at least in a
layer at
superﬁcial
the water–polymer
interface.
The aim of the present article
is to elaborate a non empirical kinetic
model
to try to answer the following
questions: Is the disinfectant–PE reaction
negligible or not? Which is the role of
oxidation? Which is the embrittlement

[8,9]

mechanism? How to predict the times to
embrittlement and fracture?

The Kinetic Model

The kinetic model for lifetime prediction is
composed of three levels.

[10,11]

i) The ﬁrst ‘‘chemical’’ level is derived
from the PE thermal oxidation mechanistic
scheme established at low temperature,
but completed to take into account the
main stabilization reactions by phenols
antioxidants,
and the chemical attack of
PE and these antioxidants by radicals
coming from the disinfectant Y8.
This
scheme can be summarized as follows:

[13]

[12]

where Q represents an cage paired
alkoxyl radicals, and S and X the respective
chain scissions and crosslinking events.

gS and gCO are the respective yields for
chain scission and ketones formation, and

bAH0 and bAHL are the respective coef-

the external pipe surface).

The different transport and kinetic para-
meters: coefﬁcients of diffusion Di and antioxi-
dant extraction/evaporation bi, rate constants
ki and yields gi, have been determined step
by step in previous studies dedicated to:

- Thermal oxidation of pure PE at
moderate temperature (typically for
T < 80 8C);

[10,11]

- Oxidation of pure and stabilized PE
initiated by the chemical attack by
chlorinated disinfectants in high con-
centration in water (up to 100 ppm) at
low temperature (at 20 and 40 8C);

[13–14]

Their values are recalled in Table 1.
This ‘‘stiff’’ system of differential equa-
tions has been numerically solved using the
Rosenbrock’s semi-implicit algorithm. Its
resolution gives access to the spatial dis-
tribution in the pipe wall (against z) of the
concentrations of the different chemical
species involved in the mechanistic scheme
(in particular, the numbers of chain scis-
sions S and crosslinking events X), and its
change against time of exposure (t).

The principal goal of these functions is to
generate, at any time t, the molar mass
proﬁle in the pipe wall.

iii) In order to predict the pipes lifetime,
it is necessary to interface the kinetic model
with a third ‘‘mechanical’’ level, in which
are coupled the creep and chemical degra-
dation effects. This last stage is derived
from the regression plots obtained in pure
water (without disinfectant) and from the
three following assumptions.

Application to Chloride Dioxide
(DOC)

There are several ways to check the validity
of the kinetic model. As an example, one
can calculate the proﬁles in the pipe wall of:

- Antioxidants concentration (determined
by differential calorimetry, assuming that
the oxidation induction time (OIT) is
directly proportional to the remaining
antioxidants concentration

[17,18]

);

prediction of PE pipes transporting drink-
ing pressurized water disinfected (but also
non disinfected) by free radical reagents.
The two ﬁrst levels (the ‘‘chemical’’ and the
‘‘physical’’ levels) calculate, at any time t,
the value of MW in an elementary sublayer
situated at an arbitrarily depth, for instance
100 mm,
in the internal pipes wall. The
value of MW is
then injected in the
‘‘mechanical’’
level which calculates, at
any time t, the values of the ‘‘strain’’ e and
the endlife criterion eF. The failure is reached
when e equals eF, as shown in Figure 2.

[16]

- Carbonyl groups build-up (determined by

IR spectrophotometry);

- Chlorine grafted to polymer (determined

by elemental analysis);

- Weight average molar masses (deter-
mined by rheometry in molten state);

One can also determine the lifetimes of
pipes naturally aged in the drinking water
distribution networks.

Of course, the predictions are as good as
the input data of the kinetic model are. In
practice, the main unknown parameters are:

- The initial composition (exact nature and
concentration of antioxidants) and struc-
tural state (cristallinity) of the PE under
consideration;

approach, the simulations have been made
the average values of 15 8C and
for
0.15 ppm in water (i.e. for a concentration
of DOC of [Y8]z¼0 ¼ 2.3 (cid:6) 10(cid:3)6 mol (cid:7) l(cid:3)1 in
PE). The lifetimes have been calculated for
a virtual pipe of 40 mm diameter and
4.5 mm thickness, made in a PE generation
anterior to the PE 80 one, having an initial
average molar mass of MW ¼ 150 kg (cid:7) mol(cid:3)1,
and containing an initial Irganox 1010

Simulation of regime (III) at three different water temperatures (continuous lines). Comparison to lifetimes of
pipes naturally aged in the presence of DOC in the south of France during the 1970–2005’s period (&). The
regression plot in pure water (without disinfectant) at 15 8C (~) has been determined from experimental results
reported in reference [1].

(nAH ¼ 4) concentration equals to its equi-
librium value ([AH]t¼0 ¼ 1.8 (cid:6) 10(cid:3)5 mol (cid:7) l(cid:3)1).
Examples of simulations are given in
Figure 3,4 and 5. In each case, one observes
a satisfying agreement between theory and
experiment.

Conclusion

A kinetic model has been built for the
lifetime prediction of PE pipes transporting
slightly pressurized (between 3 and 12 bars)
drinking water disinfected by l disinfectants
which are free radical reagents. This model
simulates satisfyingly the degradation pro-
ﬁles (oxidation induction time, antioxidants
and oxidation products
concentration,
average molar masses, etc . . .), and via an
empirical law, the ‘‘strain’’ in the pipe wall.
The failure occurs when the ‘‘strain’’ e
reaches a critical value eF depending of the
weight average molar mass MW in an
elementary sublayer situated at a depth
of 100 mm in the internal pipe wall.

Although more rigorous checking tests
remain to be accomplished yet, it appears
clearly that the kinetic model predicts the
good order of magnitude of lifetimes in the
case of a water treatment by chlorine dioxide.
