Aging of unﬁlled polyethylene (PE) ﬁlms in concen-
trated (80–100 ppm) chlorine dioxide (DOC) solutions at
208C and 40 has been studied by IR spectrophotome-
try, melt rheometry, chlorine titration, and tensile test-
ing to establish the mechanisms of PE degradation
induced by DOC, to determine some important kinetic
parameters, to identify the embrittlement mechanism,
and to examine the possibility to predict nonempirically
embrittlement
from a kinetic model. Experimental
results reveal that DOC initiates PE oxidation. This lat-
ter is responsible for hydroperoxide build-up, and chain
scissions occur when hydroperoxides reach a critical
concentration above which they decompose bimolecu-
larly. The weight average molar mass Mw decreases
and embrittlement occurs when Mw approaches a
value of 70 kg mol21 as previously found in thermooxi-
dation studies. A mechanistic scheme involving all the
elementary steps of PE autooxidation plus one initia-
tion and one termination step involving DOC has been
elaborated. The kinetic scheme derived from this
mechanistic scheme has been solved numerically and
the results of simulations have been compared with
experimental
results. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 49:1429–1437,

INTRODUCTION

It is well known that the polyethylene (PE) pipes con-
taining pressurized water undergo failure after a time tF
which is a decreasing function of pressure p and tempera-
ture T. Laboratory isothermal, isobaric experiments aimed
to establish the dependence of tF with T and p, are usually

translated into (log r 2 log tF) graphs, r being the hoop
stress. International standards, starting from the observa-
tion that, in certain (r, tF) domains, these plots are quasi
linear, propose to characterize the material by the equa-
tions of
[NFT 54091
(AFNOR)]. In the case of polyethylenes used until the
beginning of
this century (the last PE generation:
PE100 will not be considered here), three kinetic regimes
corresponding to three distinct
in the
(log r 2 log tF) graph were distinguished [1–3]. Regime
I, at high stresses and low lifetimes, is characterized by a
low slope: d(log r)/d(log tF) (cid:1) 0.03 and by a ductile frac-
ture. Regime II, at lower stresses, is characterized by a
higher slope: d(log r)/d(log tF) (cid:1) 0.3 and by a brittle
fracture. Regime III, at low stresses, is also characterized
by a brittle fracture, but the slope is higher than in regime
II. The difference between Regimes II and III can be
established from molar mass measurements. The molar
mass distribution is not affected in Regime II, whereas it
is shifted toward low values in Regime III. In other
words, Regimes I and II are modes of ‘‘physical aging,’’
whereas Regime III is a mode of chemical aging. Regimes
II and III are in competition. If chemical degradation is fast
enough, Regime II totally disappears (see Fig. 1).

Water is not reactive with PE, but it contains generally
two reactive species: oxygen and disinfectants. PE autoxi-
typically T (cid:2)
dation is very slow at
808C, but it can become signiﬁcant in a timescale compa-
rable with the transition between Regimes I and II, at
higher temperatures. Aging of PE tubes under pressure in
hot water has been extensively studied by a Swedish
group [3–6]. In the temperature range under investigation
(T ‡ 908C), the pipe durability seems to be governed by
the antioxidant migration [3–6]. At lower temperatures,

double bonds. The overall unsaturation concentration esti-
mated from band absorbances was about 11 3 1023 mol
l21 against about 60 mol l21 for methylenes. Despite the
fact that double bonds are more reactive than methylenes
(in polymethylenic sequences) toward oxidation,
it has
been previously checked, experimentally and from model
simulations, that, such a low concentration plays a negli-
gible role in the whole oxidation kinetics.

The PE sample contained also an antioxidant which
was not identiﬁed. As it will be shown in the second part
of this article, the antioxidant is rapidly consumed and
plays a negligible role on polymer oxidation kinetics,
especially in the accelerated aging conditions under study.
Films of 100 6 30 lm thickness were compression
molded at 1808C under 3 MPa pressure. Two types of
samples were cut from the ﬁlms: dogbone samples of
22 mm calibrated length for tensile testing and 25 3 25
mm squares for physicochemical testing.

Aging Tests

The PE samples were immersed in 80–90 ppm DOC
solutions at 208C or 408C with two distinct pH values: 2–
3 and 6. DOC was periodically titrated and its concentra-
tion readjusted at its initial value.

DOC solutions were produced by reaction of chlorite
anion with chlorydric acid in stoechiometric excess. The
global reaction can be summarized as follows:

5NaClO2 þ 4HCl ! 4ClO2 þ 5NaCl þ 2H2O:

The excess of chlorydric acid increases the reaction

yield.

Sample Characterization

Tensile testing was made on an INSTRON 4301
machine at 238C, 50% RH, at a 7.5 3 1023 s21 strain
rate. IR spectrophotometry (Bruker IFS 28) was used in
transmittance mode to determine the absorbance of the
carbonyl peak at (cid:1)1720 cm21. The carbonyl concentra-
tion was determined using the Beer-Lambert
law with
a molar absorptivity of 200 l mol21 cm21. Rheometry
(Rheometrics ARES) was used to record the viscosity-
angular frequency curves at 1608C in nitrogen atmos-
phere. Examples of such curves are shown in Fig. 2. The
viscosity at

slightly and then, decreases continuously. The average
molar mass MW was determined from the universal scal-
ing law:

however, the ‘‘oxidation lifetime’’ becomes longer than
the ‘‘physical aging’’ lifetime and Regime II becomes (in

mode. Disinfectants, especially chlorine derivatives, are
known to destroy organic compounds, often by radical
processes. PE does not display an especially high radical
reactivity, but zero reactivity would be surprising, because
radical reactions are never totally selective. Furthermore,
PE contains antioxidants, among which phenols are highly
reactive in radical processes. Disinfectants are thus
expected to have a deleterious effect on PE pipe durabil-
ity, at least from their destabilizing effect. This latter has
been clearly put in evidence from experimentally estab-
lished stabilizer concentration proﬁles. The stabilizer is
consumed more rapidly in the presence than in the ab-
sence of disinfectant
in a superﬁcial
in water, at
layer at the water–polymer interface [7, 8]. Which is the
embrittlement mechanism in this case? Is the disinfectant-
PE reaction negligible or not? Which is the role of oxida-
tion? How to predict embrittlement and fracture times in
this case?

least

The present article is aimed to try to answer the above
questions in the case where the disinfectant is chlorine
dioxide (DOC). In a ﬁrst part, DOC-PE reactions will be
studied in controlled conditions,
to establish the main
degradation mechanisms and the corresponding kinetic
parameters. Unﬁlled PE ﬁlms will be used in this study to
avoid analytical problems due to degradation proﬁles (dif-
fusion controlled processes) and to the presence of carbon
black. The second part will be devoted to the study of
degradation proﬁles in pipes exposed to accelerated or
natural aging and the coupling between the stress state
and the chemical degradation, to try to predict failure.

EXPERIMENTAL

Material

The PE sample under study was obtained from metal-
locene catalyzed polymerization and presents the follow-
ing characteristics: weight average molar mass: Mw ¼
109 kg mol21; polydispersity index: Ip (cid:3) 2; density: q ¼
0.934; melting point: Tm ¼ 129.38C; crystallinity ratio:

(see Fig. 4). Taking arbitrarily eR ¼ 100% as an embrit-
tlement criterion, one ﬁnds an embrittlement
time of
about 500 h at 408C. The samples keep some ductility af-
ter 1200 h at 208C. Embrittlement appears as practically
pH independent.

Oxidation Products

Examples of IR spectra are shown in Fig. 5. Bands
grow at 3300–3500 cm21 (hydroxyls) and at 1680–1750
cm21 (carbonyls). Carbonyl build-up kinetic curves are
shown in Fig. 6. Carbonyl growth is faster at 408C than
at 208C and practically pH independent.

Molar Mass Changes

Weight average molar mass MW determined from rheo-
metric measurements was plotted against exposure time in
Fig. 7. At 408C Mw increases slightly in the early days of
exposure, and then decreases continuously to reach 20–
30% of its initial value after 1200 h. At 208C, MW also
increases slightly in the early days of exposure, but its
further change is too small to be measurable, so that MW
(1200 h) is practically equal to its initial value within ex-
perimental incertitudes.

Chlorine Content

Chlorine is grafted to the polymer. Its concentration
increases almost linearly with exposure time (see Fig. 8)
to reach a value of the order of 0.22 mol l21 at 408C and
0.11 mol l21 at 208C, after 1200 h.

DISCUSSION

Chlorine dioxide is a free radical in ground state:

These results call for the following comments:
Each chain scission is probably accompanied by car-
bonyl formation because it results essentially from b scis-
sion of alkoxy radicals. However, there are almost four
times more carbonyls than chain scissions that shows the
existence of chemical events forming carbonyls without
chain scission. The ﬁrst mechanism which comes in mind
is the Russel’s termination one [11]:

As a radical, DOC can abstract hydrogen on phenolic
antioxidants (AH) and on polyethylene (PH). In this latter
case, it initiates radical chain oxidation. Oxygen can come
from water but also from atmosphere by diffusion through
the pipe wall. It will be considered here that oxygen dis-
solved in water is in equilibrium with atmosphere and that
its concentration in PE obeys Henry’s law:

½O2(cid:7)equ ¼ S pO2;

with S ¼ 1.8 (cid:4) 10–8 mol l–1 Pa–1 [10].

Radical chain oxidation leads to the formation of
hydroperoxides (POOH) among other reaction products.
As DOC is in relatively low concentration in PE and as
its reactivity with PE is relatively low, the oxidation rate
remains low as long as hydroperoxides are stable. At T (cid:2)
408C, unimolecular POOH decomposition is extremely
slow, its rate constant is of the order of 8 3 10212 s21 at
408C. But, if the POOH concentration reaches a critical
value of the order of 3 3 1023 mol kg21, then hydroper-

If the number of chain scissions was proportional to
the number of carbonyls, it would be (cid:1)14 3 1022 mol
l21 at 208C,
that would correspond to MW ¼ 66 kg
mol21, against 109 kg mol21 for the initial value. Such a
change would be easily observable. The fact
that no
change was observed at 208C after 1200 h indicates thus
that the mechanism of chain scission has not been acti-
vated at this temperature. A possible reason is that chain
scission results essentially from hydroperoxide decompo-
sition and that the critical value of hydroperoxide concen-
tration, above which bimolecular decomposition becomes
predominant, has not been reached after 1200 h at 208C.

Hydroperoxide decomposition generates alkoxy radi-
cals, which are precursors of chain scission, and its acti-
vation energy is relatively high ((cid:1)100 kJ mol21) that can
explain the difference between exposures at 40 and 208C.
Indeed, if the proposed mechanism is valid, one would
expect autoacceleration and chain scissions after a certain
exposure time (longer than 1200 h) at 208C, because
hydroperoxides also accumulate at this temperature.

Concerning the embrittlement process,

it has been
recently found that PE becomes brittle when its average
molar mass MW becomes lower than a critical value of
the order of 70 6 30 kg (cid:9) mol21 whatever its initial mor-
phology [12]. Interpolation on the curve MW ¼ f(t) in
Fig. 7 gives an embrittlement
time of about 500 h at
408C using MW ¼ 70 kg mol21 as an ‘‘endlife criterion.’’
This value agrees with the experimental one, obtained
from mechanical measurements and taking eR ¼ 100% as
an ‘‘endlife criterion’’ (see Fig. 3). It appears thus that a
kinetic model giving numbers s and x of chain scissions
and crosslinks, i.e., allowing to calculate MW at every ex-
posure time, could be used to predict the embrittlement
time using the above criterion.

The presence of chlorine grafted to the polymer in
aged samples can be tentatively attributed to the combina-
tion of DOC with alkyl radicals to give organic chlorites:

O¼¼Cl(cid:5)(cid:5)O(cid:6) þ P(cid:6) ! O¼¼Cl(cid:5)(cid:5)O(cid:5)(cid:5)P.

As DOC induces PE oxidation, as shown by the build-
up of hydroxyl and carbonyl groups, the nucleus of the
mechanistic scheme must be the same as for thermooxida-
tion. We have chosen to use the scheme recently estab-
lished for PE thermooxidation at low temperature [13], to
which both reactions involving DOC have been added
(Table 1). The mechanistic scheme calls for following
comments:

Reactions of P8 radicals cannot be ignored because, in
the following, the scheme will be applied to thick samples
(the pipe wall) in which oxidation and DOC attack are
diffusion controlled.

through radical
combinations,
Crosslinking occurs
which are a mode of
termination among others (for
instance disproportionation). The yield of crosslinking is
0.50 for termination IV and 0.0108 for termination V at
408C. Crosslinking occurs also in termination VI (see
later).

In termination, it has been chosen to differentiate the
distinct elementary processes, which leaded to consider
four reactions (VIa–VId). Q is the caged pair of alkoxy
radicals:

As it has been shown before [13], a part of alkoxy rad-
icals escape from the cage (reaction VId) to initiate new
radical chains and to give chain scissions.

Elementary rate constants k1u, k1b, k2, k3, k4, k5, k6a,
k6b, k6c, and k6d have been previously determined [13]
and will be used here without modiﬁcation. Only k5 has
been slightly modiﬁed to improve the quality of the simu-
lation. Their Arrhenius parameters and their values at
408C are given in Table 2.

The Arrhenius parameters of reactions k1d and k7 (i.e.,
DOC reactions) can be considered as preliminary estima-
tions, which need further checking. As a matter of fact,
they were determined from only two points (at 408C and
208C), among which one (208C) was obtained from
incomplete data (exposure stopped before the end of the
induction period). It can be considered that rate constant

values at 408C are correct but that the values determined
at 208C are susceptible of modiﬁcation.

The activation energy of the termination rate constant
k6a can appear surprisingly high. It is probably due to the
fact that, for species in low concentration such as peroxy
radicals, bimolecular reactions are diffusion controlled.
Activation energy is lower for termination involving P8
radicals because these latter migrate faster through va-
lence migration:

P(cid:6) þ PH ! PH þ P(cid:6):

The yield parameters ci correspond to the following

processes:

c1S (¼ 1.0 at 408C) is the yield of chain scissions from
an alkoxy radical in reactions Iu, Ib, or VId. Chain scis-
sion is eventually in competition with hydrogen abstrac-
tion.

c1CO (¼ 0.70 at 408C) is the yield of carbonyls from
an alkoxy radical. In fact, each chain scission involves
the formation of a carbonyl (an aldehyde in the case of
PE):

whereas each termination VIc gives a ketone.

The fact that c1CO differs from c1s comes from the fact
that the contribution of aldehydes to the peak at 1720 cm21
differs from the one of ketones. But, for the sake of sim-
plicity, only one carbonyl species was considered in the
calculation.

The DOC rate constants: k1d and k7 are determined
from the above reported experimental data and the kinetic
model (Appendix B) using an inverse approach [14].

The initial conditions are listed in Table 3.
The set of differential equations derived from the
mechanistic scheme of Table 1 is presented in Appendix
B. The measurable quantities [CO], MW and [P(cid:5)(cid:5)Cl] are
calculated and plotted in Figs. 6–8. One can observe an

apparently good simulation-experiment agreement, except
perhaps for kinetic curves of MW at 208C (see Fig. 7) for
which the amplitude of MW changes over the whole time
of exposure is too small relatively to the experimental
standard deviation, to permit the determination of a corre-
lation coefﬁcient. Despite that, one can remark that the
maximum gap between the simulated curve and the exper-
imental points is not higher than 20%. On the contrary, at
408C, the amplitude of MW changes is high enough to
permit
the determination of the correlation coefﬁcient:
R ¼ 0.9390.

For a so complex model, this set of three curves (at
408C and 208C) cannot be considered as a rigorous proof
of the model validity, but it must be recalled that the
major part of the model (all reactions except DOC ones)
has been validated elsewhere [13].

Concerning DOC reactions, their rate constant values

call for the following comments.

DOC is considerably less reactive than PO28 radicals as
well in hydrogen abstraction to PE: k1d/k3 (cid:3) 1023, as in
terminations: k7/k5 ¼ 1023, where k5 corresponds to the
combination:

PO(cid:6)

2 þ P(cid:6) ! POOP:

The ‘‘extrinsic initiation’’ induced by DOC is relatively
slow, but it is sufﬁcient to induce catastrophic accelera-
tion of the oxidation process in less than 500 h at 408C.

As phenolic stabilizers are at least 1000 times more re-
active than polyethylene in hydrogen abstractions, one
can expect a fast antioxidant consumption by DOC attack.
Indeed, to be used for PE pipes, the kinetic model ela-
borated here must be completed by antioxidant reactions
and by equations taking into account the reaction-diffu-
sion coupling. These aspects will be studied in the second
part of this article.

CONCLUSION

Aging of polyethylene (PE) ﬁlms in highly concen-
trated (80–100 ppm) chlorine dioxide (DOC) solutions at
20 and 408C for durations up to 1200 h has been studied
by IR spectrophotometry, tensile testing, melt rheometry,
and grafted chlorine titration.
IR revealed a carbonyl
growth indicating that DOC induces PE oxidation. Rhe-
ometry revealed the predominance of chain scissions, pre-
sumably linked to hydroperoxide decomposition. Tensile
testing revealed an embrittlement process when the
weight average molar mass MW approaches a critical
value of 70 kg mol21, which agrees with a previous study
of PE thermooxidation. The kinetic model established in
this latter study, completed with DOC elementary reac-
tions with the polymer, has been used to try to simulate
PE aging. The model agrees with experimental results
obtained at 408C and 208C for all the studied characteris-
tics. This model could appear exaggeratedly complex,

considering the monotony of experimental kinetic curves
[except for MW ¼ f(t) ones], and it could be tempting to
try to reduce the mechanistic scheme to a single rate
determining process.

However,

in the case of such degenerate branching
processes displaying an induction period and a strong
autoaccelerated behavior, there is no way, to our opinion,
to distinguish a rate determining elementary process. All
the reactions play a key role.

The model will ﬁnd its full usefulness in Part II of this
article where antioxidant reactions and diffusion-reaction
coupling will be added.

APPENDIX A: TRANSPORT PROPERTIES
OF DOC

Transport properties of DOC in PE have never been
studied to our knowledge. But, the properties of DOC are
close to the ones of sulfur dioxide (Table 4), which can
be used to estimate some DOC key characteristics, for
instance the Lennard-Jones temperature TLJ:

For a sample of crystallinity ratio XC, one can write:

Sð298 KÞ ¼ 2:2 þ 10(cid:5)2ð1 (cid:5) XCÞ

in mol m(cid:5)3 Pa(cid:5)1: (A4)

The same authors gave for the dissolution enthalpy HS:

HS
R

¼ 1000 (cid:5) 10 TLJ 6 500 ¼ (cid:5)2690 6 500 K (A5)

ClO2 dissolution in PE would be exothermic, so that
the solubility would be a decreasing function of tempera-
ture:

S ¼ S0 exp (cid:5)

HS
RT

(A6)

with S0 ¼ 2.6 (cid:4) 10–9 mol l–1 Pa–1 and HS/R ¼ 2690 K.

In the temperature interval of practical interest (20–

408C), S would keep the same order of magnitude.

To determine the DOC concentration in PE, we need
to know the DOC partial pressure p in atmosphere, in
equilibrium with the water solution. According to the
water–DOC equilibrium diagram [17], one would have:

p ¼ 11 3 10(cid:5)2 ½DOC(cid:7)Water at 20(cid:6)C;
and

p ¼ 22 3 10(cid:5)2 ½DOC(cid:7)Water at 40(cid:6)C;

where p is in Pa and [DOC]Water is the DOC weight frac-
tion in water, expressed in ppm.

It can be assumed that p obeys Arrhenius law:

p ¼ p0 exp (cid:5)

T LJ ¼ e=k;

with p0 ¼ 5.7 (cid:4) 10–4 Pa ppm–1 and Ep ¼ 26.44 kJ mol–1.

Finally,

where e is prefactor of the Lennard-Jones potential and k
the Boltzmann constant.

TLJ (SO2) is known. It will be assumed that:

TLJðDOCÞ ¼ TLJðSO2Þ

DHVðDOCÞ

([DOC]Water in ppm) and HD ¼ HS þ Hp ¼ 4.06 kJ

where DHV is the vaporization enthalpy.

One sees that the cohesive properties of ClO2 are very

Thus, it comes:

close to SO2 ones.

The solubility of DOC in PE will be calculated from
the empirical equation established by Van Amerongen
[15] and used, in the case of PE, by Michaels and Bixler
[16]:

log Sð298 KÞ ¼ (cid:5)7:0 þ 0:010 TLJ

ðS in cm3 STP cm(cid:5)3 Pa(cid:5)1Þ

ðA3Þ

So that S(298 K) ¼ 2.2 3 1022 mol m23 Pa21 in

amorphous phase.

½DOC(cid:7) ¼ 1:4 3 10(cid:5)3 mol 1(cid:5)1

at 20 and 40(cid:6)C

for a DOC concentration in water of 80–90 ppm.

APPENDIX B: KINETIC MODEL

The kinetic model is the system of differential equa-
tions derived from the chosen mechanistic scheme (in Ta-
ble 1). This system is composed of differential equations
corresponding to the reactive species, plus the equations
allowing to compute the measurable quantities such as the
